[{"title":"On Mahayana Patriarchs","content":"Mahayana Buddhism has a special class of teachers called Patriarchs. They have the following characteristics:They are enlightened teachers. This means that they were certified as enlightened by an enlightened patriarch, unlike many of the teachers of our era who call themselves “enlightened” without having received this crucial certification. They may be able to fool ordinary people, but they cannot mislead the genuine Buddhist sages. Except for the real patriarchs, enlightened teachers would rarely admit that they are enlightened in private, let alone proclaim so in public. Patriarchs are certified teachers, meaning that they were certified by another patriarch. As such, the first Mahayana Patriarch, Ven. Mahakashyapa, was certified by Shakyamuni Buddha. Ven. Mahakashyapa then designated Ven. Ananda as second Patriarch. And the Orthodox Buddhism lineage of patriarchs was thus passed on from generation to generation. The Mahayana Patriarchs are responsible for propagating the Orthodox Buddhism (theory), or the so-called Proper Dharma. In other words, their teachings are consistent with the Buddha’s teachings. Therefore, students new to Buddhism are better off by starting to learn from the Patriarch’s teachings to obtain the proper reference points and build the proper foundation for their practice. Thus, one fundamental task for an Orthodox Buddhism Patriarch is to help interpret and explain the Buddha’s profound teachings which we’d otherwise be unable to fathom.The last known Mahayana Patriarch (and the first American Patriarch) is Master XuanHua who founded the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association. Before he entered Nirvana, he designated the second Patriarch who still hasn’t revealed himself at the time of this writing (25 years after Master XuanHua’s death).​      Mahayana Buddhism consists of both theory and practice. Consequently, the academics may understand the theory but do not understand the practice. Practice requires special training from certified teachers. Traditionally, the main lineage of Orthodox Buddhism (started by Shakyamuni Buddha) relies on Chan meditation as its main form of training of certified teachers.Patriarchs have differing levels of enlightenment. While most of the Patriarchs are responsible for the continuance of Mahayana (propagation of the theory), the greater Patriarchs, like Master XuanHua, excel at teaching us how to become enlightened (practice vs. theory) because he left behind a lot of enlightened students in his wake.​"},{"title":"Engaging in Battles","content":"The ancients have the following rules regarding when to not to go into battle:When the country is disharmonious, do not try to conquer new territories.When the army is disharmonious, do not engage in battles.When engaged in a battle and the army is disharmonious, do not advance the army.When advancing the army while it is disharmonious, do not try win the battle at any cost.The people must feel that their leaders engage in thorough planning, carefully evaluating all options and valuing the people’s lives for them to make sacrifices for the good of the country.​      This applies to the country as well as the family at the micro level. The key is to expand externally, the unit (whether it’s a country or a company or a family) must be in harmony. Harmony must be established first before important undertakings can begin.​"},{"title":"To Value Righteousness Over Money","content":"Mr. Phạm Trọng Yêm was prime minister of the Song Dynasty and yet he was poor his entire life. He valued righteousness over money and loved to do charity work. He saved enough money from his salary to buy a plot of land to plant crops and used the proceeds to do charity work. Whoever needed help with funerals and marriages, could come to him for help. His son was Thuần Nhân and was a spitting image of him. He was an official at a small province, saved enough to buy five barrels of grain to bring home to his father. On the way home, he met with his father’s old friend who fell on hard times and had three deaths in the family. So, he gave him the five barrels of grain to help. Furthermore, the father’s friend also had two daughters who could not get married because they lacked dowries. So, he gave them his boat as well.So, the son came home empty handed. His father inquired about the trip.The son said, “I met with your old friend who was in financial difficulties and also had three funerals in the household. So, I gave him the five barrels of grains which I fear still wasn’t enough.”“Why didn’t you give them your boat?” asked his father.“I did,” was the reply.His father exclaimed, “Attaboy!”      These superior men’s story beautifully illustrates the Mahayana practice of giving: Give until it hurts. And then continue giving.​"},{"title":"Embracing Others","content":"The thunder cannot be reduced in sound to harmonize with the sound of the bells.

He came to visit the Qi齊 king. After looking at the king for a while, he told the king that he had a skin condition that should be treated quickly before it became worse.The Qi king replied that he was disease free. So, BQ walked out. The Qi king laughed and said, “What a slick snake oil salesman! He was trying to cure a healthy person to make a name for himself.”Ten days later, BQ came again and then said, “Your Highness has a liver problem. You’d better treat quickly.”The King’s face turned very dissatisfied. So, BQ walked out.Ten days later BQ came to see the Qi king. He took one look at the king and immediately walked out. The Qi king sent people to ask BQ about his sudden exit. HC said: “Skin conditioned can be cured by acupuncture, liver illness can be cured with herbs but once the illness gets to the bone marrow, it’s too late for treatment!”Five days later, the Qi king did become ill and no doctor could save him. He died as a result.       Ordinary people tend to ignore their illness, maybe because ordinary doctors cannot see grave illnesses. BQ was a great doctor, that’s why he could recognize morrow illness. But he was not good enough to cure those types of illnesses.​Practicing Chan can help you address illnesses that are based on the bone marrow when your samadhi level is sufficiently high. In general, if you practice Chan every day, it is unlikely that illnesses can progress into the bone marrow."},{"title":"The End of a Country","content":"What are the signs that people in the past used to determine if a country was on the decline?The country stored enough food and fortified the ramparts, neglecting to care for its citizens and felt confident that it was strong enough to fend off the enemies. Its king was not keen on working hard to maintain the independence of the country. The crown prince was weak and cowardly. The rich elite were extravagant in their expenditures and indulged in lust. The officials were arrogant, greedy and cruel. The government was heavily polarized, and no one would assume responsibility.​If that country is in between two stronger countries, it would not last ten years.      Such a country defeats itself and invites other countries to annex them.​"},{"title":"Kong Minh’s Advice to His Son","content":"The Chinese man, who was the personification of intelligence, cleverness and loyalty, once wrote a letter of advice to his son.“...The superior man must be still and pure in order to cultivate. He must know moderation to nurture virtue. If one is not calm and dispassionate then one cannot be clear-headed. Deep knowledge requires quietude, lack of rashness and no temper.To study one must be still and pure. Talented people still need to study or else their talents are narrow in scope. Lacking stillness and purity then one cannot really study. Laziness and arrogance will preclude thorough knowledge. Viciousness and brute force prevent reforming one’s character.​Each year the body ages and becomes weaker and sick. To sigh and lament of missed opportunities would only be in vain...”      The Asian culture stresses cultivating one’s body and mind and nurturing one’s virtue. One must strive to develop talent and knowledge.​Buddhists are taught to cultivate morality, samadhi and wisdom which will help us realize our highest potential."},{"title":"You Already Know This","content":"Innocent and neither good nor evil, such is our nature when we are born into the world.Liking good and disgusted with evil is because that’s what (most of us) we gravitate towardRejecting good and identifying with evil happens when we are influenced by bad habits, thus putting us on the road toward steady decline.Turning from evil to good can happen through cultivation, thus helping improve ourselves steadily.​Regress or improvement, you yourself know it: you should never try to fool yourself.

To be able to bear bitterness is to be patient and therefore you will stay for the long haul. Knowing what is thin means that you are tolerant and therefore can work with small people.

Silk takes on the color of the dye that is used. Dye it five times, it will change color five times: therefore, one must use the dye carefully.      Furthermore, people can have similar dyeing effect on each other. Get close to someone good and you’ll become a good person. Befriend a bad person and you’ll become a bad person. Fame or infamy largely depends on with whom you associate.* * * * *   Mo Zi can only see at the friend level but cannot see it at the teacher’s level.

People pay taxes in order to pay for the official’s salary in order for the official to administer justice for the populace. Unfortunately, it is so sad to see that nowadays, the official collects his salary but is tardy at administering public work and in some cases even steals from the citizens.      Now that you are coming into this important official position, you should get up early in the morning and work into late at night to administer to your duties. You must diligently apply yourself to your civic duties, give out fair judgments on law suits, set fair and reasonable fees, treat the old and young equitably. Only then would you have justly earned your salary.”*****​​This applies to public servants at all levels, including politicians.One can employ rhetoric as one pleases. The bottom line is that great officials will bring prosperity and security to the nation. Lousy ones will hurt the treasury and weaken the nation’s standing in the world. History will have the final word."},{"title":"Don’t Be So Inflexible!","content":"​The ancients said the following:Heavens cannot make flowers bloom out of season. Therefore, sages observe timeliness.Mother Earth cannot change the seasons. Therefore, sages do not violate traditions.      Even the sages cannot walk with their hands or grab things with their feet. Therefore, sages must know their limitations.And sages cannot make fish fly or birds swim. Therefore, sages must respect others’ limitations.​Thus, wise people know when to advance, when to retreat; when to be clear, when to be vague.One should not be inflexible.*****​​Clear-headed people and wise people can see farther and broader (the big picture). That’s from the theoretical perspective.However, Buddhism has the concept of the “obstruction of what is known”: it’s your own smarts, knowledge or wisdom that will obstruct and impede you.​In that case, the faster way to resolve it is to follow your Good Knowing Adviser’s instructions."},{"title":"The People Come First","content":"​According to Mencius, for the country to be strong, it needs three components:1. The people.2. The land.3. The king.​In that order.​Although the people lack authority and power, they have the power of the mass. Therefore, theyare ranked first.      ​Land comes from the Chinese concept of shè jì 社 稷; shè refers to the spirit guardian of the land while jì refers to the spirit in charge of the crops (harvests). The Chinese are aware that each area has a land spirit who guards it and the harvest spirit can affect the harvests. Although the land is supported by the spirits, the spirits are supported by the offerings and prayers of the people therefore, the people outweighs the land.  Finally, the king is the leader of the spirits and people. However, he must rely on the people’s support and love and the spirits’ protection to last at his job. Therefore, the king comes in third.* * * * *The Buddhist has a secret.For the people to be well educated and to do well, for the spirits to be supportive and the king to be a good leader, you enlist the sages to come and live in your country.

He became a great politician and general in the Zheng鄭 country in China. He was a very benevolent leader.Zi Chan fell very ill. So he called Zi Tai Shu 子太叔 and said, “After my death, you’ll have to govern the country. You should know that virtuous people must use benevolence and harmony to inspire respect from the people while ordinary people must use awe and strictness to govern the country.      ​It is like fire. Being hot, it creates fear in people and that is why few people die from fire.Whereas water, being cool, it makes people underestimate its danger and therefore more die from drowning. In general, being benevolent and yet still creating harmony is not easy.”A few months later Zi Chan died and Zi Tai Shu replaced him as general. He however could not find it in his heart to be stern and forceful. He instead chose to use benevolence and harmony as a ruler. As a result, the country had a lot of bandits and robberies. So Zi Tai Shu realized the errors of his ways, followed Zi Chan’s doctrine and used the army to capture and execute the bandits and robbers.When Confucius heard of the story, he commented, “Very good, indeed! When the ruler is benevolent then the people misbehave. When the population do not follow the rules then force must be utilized. When using force then the people will perish and are weakened. Then one must to resort back to benevolence. Benevolence can help force and force can complement benevolence: that is harmony.”* * * * *Harmony as per the Confucians simply is the Middle Way in Buddhism: it’s the art of managing people to maintain balance while being virtuous.As my late teacher pointed out, besides political skills, country leaders must also maintain morality as the core."},{"title":"Loyalty Versus Individualism","content":"In the Qi 齊 country, there was a man who was an official in the king’s court. He was bestowed land, riches and titles and was very well off. When the Qi king was in danger, he refused to sacrifice his life to save the king.One day, he met an old acquaintance who saw him in astonishment, “I thought you were dead!”      He calmly replied, “No, I’m still alive as you can very well see. I was a subject of the Qi king because it was beneficial. To die along with him is of no benefit, so I refused to die with him.”His old acquaintance said, “If you are like that, how could face your ancestors?”​He immediately retorted, “So you really believe that after you die, you will get to see yourancestors?”​In ancient times, if one receives favors from the king and yet one is not willing to die for him, then that is great disloyalty.In modern times, that logic is considered outdated. We look at relationships as mutuallybeneficial: you give me something then I’ll reciprocate.Which is reasonable? It depends on where you come from. If you yourself act as judge, then of course it is reasonable to behave like the disloyal official because the ego does not like to take a loss.In my personal case, I was miserable and evil before I met my teacher, Great Master XuanHua. He accepted me and taught me how to cultivate. Because of cultivation, I totally changed and became the opposite person of what I was. Therefore, I owe my life to my late Master. As a result, I don’t look at it as loyalty but I committed the rest of my life to help continue his work in order to pay back his act of kindness. For me, it’s about paying back your debts."},{"title":"Only Seeing Oneself","content":"​The ancient said:​“Man often commits the myriad of offenses because of this illness called, “Only Seeing Oneself”.

In other words, he doesn’t care for other living beings and has no respect for the rules of morality and propriety. Therefore, he may have a human body, but he is no better than an animal.      If mankind could get rid of this “Me First” sickness and their hearts are generous and fair, then whether rich and lofty, poor and lowly, endangered and suffering, experiencing bitter failure, in danger of losing their lives, they still are in communion with all others and in accord with the rules of morality and propriety: that is truly self and others united in one substance.”* * * * *Modern society’s recent developments can be attributed to the culture of the individual. However, in order to ensure continued advancements, we must wake up to the necessity of benefitting others as part of our moral compass.

That is why the small person only has worries his entire life.”       * * * * * Worldly people have many worries because their greed has no bounds.​The superior man only is greedy to help others. That is why he is happy for trying his best instead of being attached to results."},{"title":"The Two Concubines","content":"Dương Chu (DC), a known scholar in China, stayed at an inn during one of his travels. The inn keeper had two concubines, one pretty and one ugly. The pretty one was not liked while the ugly one was well-liked. DC asked the resident children why. They said, “The pretty wife was aware of her beauty and therefore lost her appeal; we no longer saw her as pretty. Whereas the ugly wife was well aware of her lack of beauty and therefore compensated for it; thus we no longer see her as unattractive.”      DC turned to his accompanying students and said, “You should remember this. The superior person should forget about his superiority and in doing so, he makes himself likable. He will be welcomed everywhere he goes.” * * * * * Those who are too proud of their talents or looks tend to be boastful and arrogant and therefore are not liked and respected by others. In contrast, the untalented and unattractive tend to be more aware of their weaknesses.  They learn to compensate with good manners and humility. They are more liked and might even have a chance to be taken as a spouse.​Humility is the basis of virtue. This lesson should be taught to children while they are still impressionable."},{"title":"Choosing Who To Help","content":"Dương Hổ (DH) was a high ranking general during the Warring States era in China.

I also assisted more than half of the court officials. And more than half of the frontier officials were appointed because of my support as well. Then those attendant officials slandered me, those court officials used the letter of the law to give me a guilty verdict and those frontier officials used their own weapons against me!”​TGT said, “You are so wrong! That was from your own doing.

Explain yourself quickly or else I’ll have your head chopped!”“I was simply deducing from the way I make wooden wheels. They need to be carved just right: not too small nor too big. Each time is different and one cannot follow any preset process. This cannot be spelled out in detail. That is why I could not teach my children nor could they thoroughly pick it up from me. As a result, even at the ripe age of 70, I still have to fashion wooden cart wheels!Similarly, the ancients’ deep wisdom cannot be transmitted to later generations. What is written can be considered to be rejected knowledge of the ancients.”The king loved the logic. He pardoned the wood craftsman and even gave him a generous reward. * * * * *Written words cannot convey the essence of the sages’ teachings.Even the Chan meditation school recognizes that the enlightened beings’ teachings must be conveyed as “not relying on words or languages.” In other words, we train the students to experience it themselves rather than giving them knowledge.​Worldly people overvalue knowledge and views instead of emphasizing the development of real wisdom through personal training."},{"title":"Slighting Others","content":"Tử Kích (TK) was rich and powerful official.

How can the high and mighty dare do so? A king who snubs others can lose his country and an official who spurn others can lose his position. For someone who is competent and yet destitute (like me), wherever he goes, the king and officials do not value his counsel and refuse to implement his strategies, what has he’s got to lose by slighting others?”After TK heard, he apologized to DTP. * * * * * TK is arrogant because of his wealth and power.

Confucius’ disciples asked their teacher how he could see it coming.      Confucius explained, “To make offerings to the ancestors is to express gratitude to them.

To rely on our educators whose promotions are not based on teaching righteousness would be inadequate.       ​Instead, each day, help them hear, see and do something righteous by being such an example.

And yet people of the world never have ceased to pursue immortality.Even the Taoists method of practice can “lengthen life” but eventually they must eventually die.Therefore, we should strive to have a meaningful life in order to repay our parents’ kindness in bringing us to this world and raising us.

Good things come our way usually because of our skills just like the jade craftsman who could recognize stones that could possibly contain jade. It is therefore better to hone our skills instead of relying on luck.​As to the savvy Buddhist, we recognize that good things come our way because we planted good causes in the past.

One chooses to live by the principles of propriety (and not violate the rules and regulations). One decides to exemplify loyalty, self-respect, and bravery (and not fear loss or death).      To be greedy for fame is to fawn over and kowtow to those with influence and power.  One who desires recognition may exhibit a strange or different style, and will take no stand while straddling both fences.​Those who value fame may be silent but make sense. Those who are greedy for notoriety may be impressive but have no substance. * * * * *  Fame is rather short lived. And yet, people are so addicted to it.When the Buddha was in the world, he was widely respected by many people.

Therefore, the ruler must make sure that society is harmonious in order to accomplish great undertakings and should not solely count on any single individual.

It is no big deal because so many people in other fields also give and serve their communities freely and generously.“Not only do we feel that our contributions to society are insignificant and pale in comparison to other’s generosity, we have also learned to forget our good deed immediately after it is performed. Why? Because people who are suffering and in pain really have no strength or clarity of mind to be grateful.

If we invade our neighbors, aren’t we committing offenses with the Heavens?”The Lu King replied, “Why are you trying to talk me out of this expedition? This invasion is consistent with the Heavens’ mandate. Our neighboring country’s King killed his father to usurp the throne. Consequently, the Heavens have punished his country with three successive years of drought and disastrous harvests. Therefore, my punitive conquest is consistent with Heavens’ wishes.”“While it is true that the Heavens have punished his country for three years as a result of his evil actions,” Mo Zi commented, “That is enough. However, for you to claim that your invasion is a heavenly mandate, is no different from the case of a father whipping his disobedient son and a neighbor father also grabbing a whip to give him a beating, claiming that his actions are in accordance with his father’s wishes. Is this argument defensible?”* * * * *Using one’s strength or skills to oppress the weak while using excuses to disguise one’s selfish motives is immoral. When the cause is immoral, the pretenses are indefensible.​To use false pretext to disguise one’s greedy mind to steal from others is unprincipled. Leaders such as these will be severely judged by human history and the Heavens."},{"title":"The Wooden Kite","content":"​Mo Zi 墨子, a renowned Chinese philosopher, during the Warring States era in China 春秋末战国 took three years to make a wooden kite. After it was flown for a day, it broke.His disciples praised him, “It is incredible that you made a wooden kite that can fly!”​ “It took me three years to make that wooden kite.” Mo Zi said. “However, it could only fly for a day before it broke down. How can one be proud of that? Take the cart maker. He used some wood and in a day can make a cart that can carry heavy loads for long distances for long time periods: that is real skill!”       ​* * * * *Mo Zi skillfully crafted a kite out of wood but was dissatisfied because ultimately its usefulness was not commensurate with the labor he had to put into fabricating it. He was a remarkably humble man.By nature, Mo Zi was a frugal man who was very practical. He did not indulge in luxuries and was ardent about benefitting others.Nevertheless, great things are not always useful: greatness also resides in its essence or nature. The wooden kite, although it had limited usefulness it was the result of the superior skills of its maker. That is laudable.​It is important to remember that truly wonderful things have greatness both in their usefulness as well as in their substance. Just like the superior man is virtuous (substance or nature) and helpful to others (use)."},{"title":"On Credibility","content":"The country of Lu 鲁国 was a small country of the Warring States era, and had a priceless censor.

Nhạc Chính Tử asked, “Why don’t you give the real censor?”The Lu king replied, “I value it too much!”Nhạc Chính Tử said, “I also value my credibility as much as your Highness values his censor!”In the end, it was only after the Lu king relinquished the real censor that Nhạc Chính Tử agreed to present the tribute. * * * * *​Confucius said, “A man who lacks credibility has no place on this earth.”Furthermore, the ancients also taught that credibility is a nation’s treasure.​If the politicians and the national leaders earnestly guard their credibility then the country can prosper and become stronger."},{"title":"On Laziness","content":"​The Buddhas warned against laziness.

Instead, they should look for opportunities to pass on their knowledge to the young as well as to the adults.​Then we’ll all have a better chance at having a meaningful and happier life.

He calmly replied, “Getting another horse may actually be a misfortune!”​       Now that they had horses, his son rode them every day. Unfortunately, he fell, broke his leg and became lame. The old man coolly told his friend, “His being lame may actually be a good thing!”Not too long after, there was a rebellion in the area.

He was even-keeled and composed and avoided noisy and crowded places. He and his wife were very courteous toward one another and treated each other like guests.​One day, an official friend came for a visit and found him working in the field. Bang Cong came up to talk with his friend while his wife and children continued their field work below.       The official friend said: “You are so learned, why do you insist on ploughing the field like this? Why don’t you become an official so that you can leave some assets to your children?”Bang Cong replied: “Others tend to leave danger to their children. I tend to leave peace and security for them. Although the approach is different they are still assets for the future generations.”The official friend sighed and took his leave.*****Who does not want to take care of our children’s future?Why did Bang Cong say that normal assets are dangerous?There are many reasons. In the old days, there were a lot of upheavals in China. During the times of upheavals it used to be difficult for the children to hang on to their inherited wealth: the higher the official position, the more wealth, the more dangerous it was. Furthermore, children of well- to-do families tended to become complacent and would not apply themselves to learn or work: historically, inherited wealth tends to decrease from generation to generation.Why is working called peace and security?Bang Cong taught his children skills to make a living, the way of virtue and knowing contentment. Therefore, his children worked hard and studied hard and were satisfied. No matter whether it was during peaceful times or times of upheaval, they could fend for themselves.​I really admire Bang Cong’s humility and his people skills.

Their whole existence is about indulging in all the sense pleasures.Becoming refers to the state of existence after death during which one awaits for a period of up to 49 days before one is reincarnated. This state is also called the Intermediate Skandha Body. During this time, it’s as if one is under a yoke or is imprisoned and must await one’s fate and face judgment.Those who are under the yoke of views allow themselves to be guided by erroneous views. For example, they discriminate against race, religion, skin color, nationality and so forth because they fail to understand that we all are one and the same, that we all have the Buddha nature.​This final yoke of ignorance is one of the most difficult to unyoke. How do you know that you are ignorant? That is when you are so sure that you know the truth: this is what is referred in Buddhism as the obstruction of what is known (we are so sure of our knowledge or understanding that we do not listen any more). The better way to unyoke oneself from this is through the help of a Good Knowing Adviser."},{"title":"On The Buddhist Filial Piety","content":"​The Buddha said that his disciples should repay their parents’ kindness. He said: “Even if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder and your father on the other shoulder for 100 years, and were to look after them by anointing, massaging, bathing, and rubbing their limbs, and they were to defecate and urinate right there [on your shoulders], you would not in that way pay or repay your parents.”       “If you were to establish your mother & father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth, abounding in the seven treasures [multitudes of gems], you would not in that way pay or repay your parents. Why is that? Mother and father do much for their children. They care for them, they nourish them and they introduce them to this world.”Those who fail to take care of their parents would have failed their fundamental duties as human beings. One such way to pay them back is: “Anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother and father, settles and establishes them in conviction; rouses his unvirtuous mother and father, settles and establishes them in virtue; rouses his stingy mother and father, settles and establishes them in practicing giving; rouses his foolish mother and father, settles and establishes them in wisdom: To this extent one pays and repays one’s mother and father.”​As you can see, it is not easy to repay our parents’ kindness.

Pure Land Dharma to help send them to the Pure Land where they will be with Amitabha Buddha until they become a Buddha themselves."},{"title":"Four Kinds of Deviations","content":"​The Buddha said that one can go off course because of four reasons:​Because of desire​Because of angerBecause of stupidityBecause of fear       Because of desire: such as those who practice Tantric Buddhism because they seek special powers.Because of anger: such as those who practice Chan Buddhism and like to use their spiritual strength to impose their will on others.​Because of stupidity: such as those who practice Pure Land Buddhism but never learned how to recite the Buddha’s name properly and yet believe that they can certainly go to the Pure Land.Because of fear: such as those who never dare face their own inner fear.

Without seeing the root cause of fear, they continually revolve on the Reincarnation Wheel.In the Dharma Ending Age, some teachers still have not opened real wisdom and thus, they teach prematurely.

Most of us fall short and yet have no idea why so.      PreceptsPrecepts are the Buddhist rules of morality. It clearly describes good and evil.These concepts are absolute and not subject to individual or cultural interpretation. For example, Buddhists are taught to refrain from killing living beings because killing inflicts harm on others and creates to-be-killed consequences that we will have to endure in the future. Just because say if one lives in a cannibalistic society where killing is commonplace, societal approval of taking another’s life does not exempt one from undergoing the killing karma retributions.If anyone has any misgivings about this aspect of the universal of cause and effect, just take a look at the scientific evidence.Anyone who has taken Physics will know about the law of “force = reaction”. That is precisely a miniature model of the law of cause and effects. Whatever “karma” (action) we generate, there is a corresponding consequence that is inevitable. Do evil and evil will be done to you. Similarly, do good and good will be reciprocated to you.Make no mistake about it, there is definitely a corresponding consequence to all of our karmas. Sometimes, these consequences are immediately seen (or measurable) such as in the Physics model of force=reaction. Quite often, there is a significant time lag that may even span many lifetimes before there is payback. In some cases, one might say that “revenge is best served when cold”.Many Buddhists subscribe to this concept of cause and effect. This is why the Buddha decreed precepts or rules of morality to help us avoid making mistakes in cause and effect.For example, the Buddhist laity has the precept of “not stealing”. That is we are not supposed to take something that belongs to another without his/her permission. Let’s say that you are on the sidewalk of Paris and wisely paid attention to where you step. All of a sudden, you see a thousand franc bill on the ground. A discreet glance around the area indicates that there is no one around. What should you do? Common wisdom is that since the area is deserted, you might as well pick it up because if you don’t, someone else surely will. There is no harm in taking it right? Not so to the Buddhist, it would be considered stealing because that money must have an owner who would most likely object to our picking it up for our own personal use.In general, these precepts clearly describe these seemingly reasonable rules of conduct that can help us avoid future unpleasant consequences. And yet, although we intuitively agree to these boundaries of propriety, we often have a hard time living up to them. Didn’t scientific research recently concluded that when in the dark (can’t be seen!), people are more likely to steal?It would seem that we all agree on the moral high grounds but consistently fail when faced such tests.How come? It’s because we lack (“good”) blessings.SamadhiSamadhi is Sanskrit for concentration.Proper concentration is crucial to accomplishing most important undertakings. For example, the professional golfer who has better concentration power can focus on the task at hand instead of being distracted by the environment (wind, heat, noise, …) and especially by his/her own false-thinking (thinking about the pressure to perform, or how to celebrate if victorious etc…). Such people can deliver when they must. Maybe that’s why professional sports is turning more and more to the mental or psychological aspects of performance.Buddhists have systematic methods to developing concentration power.The most famous one is the practice of meditation.During the past five years of teaching Chan (Mahayana meditation; not Zen, Vipasana or such), our students progressed very quickly in their practice. Many of them reached quite impressive levels such Formless Realm samadhis and higher. Many more simply never could keep up with us even when they were highly motivated by their significant health improvements and bliss. Even many more simply do not buy into the meditation practice even though they see the wonderful results from the other students.How come? Not enough blessings planted in Mahayana.In contrast, there are those who are so blessed that they reached very high levels of samadhi even only after a short period of practice.How come? Plenty of blessings!WisdomWisdom denotes Prajna Wisdom or transcendental wisdom.Transcendental wisdom is the kind of wisdom that liberates us from our worldly attachments.It comes in three distinct flavors:Briefly speaking, in order to uncover our inherent wisdom, it even requires a lot more blessings than the prior two studies. For example, before we can uncover our superior intellect, we must have enough blessings to enroll in one of those top notch educational institutions! The wisdom of emptiness, seeing things as they really are: ultimately empty. Briefly, all perceived things eventually return to emptiness if one waits long enough. I don’t think you can give a counter-example of ONE thing that does not ever disintegrate.The wisdom of the mundane, seeing things as they really are: temporarily important. Even though things will eventually disintegrate, they are temporarily real to living beings. Not insist on them being ultimately empty is of no use to us for now. Wise people therefore do not deny the temporary importance (to the unwise living beings) of all things. These wise folks appear to be attached to temporary things but they really are not deep inside. For example, they work hard for a living to feed their family but would not hesitate to give it all up for the sake of others.Shakyamuni Buddha was once a crown prince with a devoted wife and two sons. He fell in disfavor with his father who decided to banish him (alone, not the rest of his family). His wife chose to follow him, sitting on a cart with all their belongings and two sons. Shakyamuni Buddha eventually gave away his most precious possession left: his two sons and then his devoted wife.The wisdom of the Middle Way: neither attach to the emptiness nor mundane. Unlike the other two wisdoms, there are no attachments to either types of wisdom. This is the Buddha’s ultimate wisdom.In summary, the successful Buddhist practitioner requires an enormous amount of blessings to make it.Want to keep precepts? Plant lots of blessings.Want to have samadhi power? Plant even more blessings.Want to have wisdom? Will certainly obtain it through the cultivation of non-outflow blessings.One must start with planting blessings: this is why we teach our followers to practice giving at the very outset. Once we understand, we never stop giving. That’s how to make it in the long haul."},{"title":"Zeng Zi and Humility","content":"​In ancient China, there was a sagely man called KL.

His brother came out of the house and stopped him, saying, “You should not mind the dog. His behavior is reasonable. If you saw him leave all white and when he returned he was all black, you could not help but become suspicious too!”* * * * *Such is the nature of knowledge: the more we know the more we are attached to the knowledge.​Therefore, those who truly understand would avoid debates and asserting their righteousness."},{"title":"Confucius’ Five Virtues","content":"​Confucius taught that people should nurture the Five Virtues: Humaneness, Principle, Etiquette, Knowledge and Trustworthiness. We should take a closer look at them and compare them against the Buddhist teachings.       ​In general:Humaneness: Dwell at quiet places. One is at ease and unruffled, having a non-fighting attitude, embraces others and treats them with equanimity. This is exactly the Bodhisattva spirit in Mahayana: inside, one’s mind is at peace and pure; outside, one is non-discriminating and works to save all living beings. Therefore, one works hard at developing one’s samadhi, non-discrimination and compassion.Principle: At all times, be in accord with the rules and regulations of nature and the laws of the country. One’s resolve is unflagging, one’s nature is unchanging and one’s mind is undaunted. The ancients valued loyalty and slighted those who sacrificed the principles for survival, let alone for small gains. The Buddhists who understand these principles tend to be grateful and strive to repay others’ kindness.Etiquette: This includes all that elucidates the rules and regulations, thereby creating respect and regard, maintaining order and according with the true and ever-lasting principles. Those who lack etiquette should not be befriended, drawn near to, or frequented lest one will regret such relationships in the future. In Buddhism, the principle is equivalent to the Vinaya, the teaching of the moral precepts and rules of comportment. Those who understand the Vinaya will always be humble and respectful of others.Knowledge: There is nothing that one does not understand just like there is nothing that water cannot penetrate. Therefore one needs to vigorously study and do sufficient research. The young and old alike must continually learn in order to develop their true wisdom. Buddhist practitioners emphasize both study and practice in order to unfold their inherent wisdom. Ultimately, when they become a Buddha, they will realize the Buddha’s All Wisdom which enables them to understand all phenomena in the worlds throughout time.Trustworthiness: This means to be unshakable, just like the earth’s cycle of the four seasons which generates the natural birth and destruction of all plants and trees. One should keep one’s word or else one will have a hard time keeping business partners and customers or keeping loved ones or friends. This is truly the spirit of the Buddhist Precept of Non-lying. Those who lie cannot succeed in Buddhist cultivation.In brief, the Five Virtues symbolize the timeless qualities of the Confucian Superior Man, the ideal man who we all admire and venerate. They are contained in the Mahayana ideal of the Bodhisattva."},{"title":"The Proper Way to Live","content":"Yan Hui, Confucius’ wisest disciple asked: “I want to be poor but as if I am rich, lowly but as if I am of high station, lacking in physical strength but as if I can command respect, and indulge myself my entire life without any fear. Is that reasonable?”      Confucius replied: “To be poor and yet feel rich, one must be content with one’s lot and be greedy for nothing. To be lowly and yet feel noble, one must be yielding and respectful. To lack in physical strength and yet feel respected, one must be cautious, respectful and avoid making mistakes. To indulge oneself all life long without any fear, one must choose one’s words carefully before speaking.”* * * * *In other words, those who know how to live:​Are very rich because they are free from desire.Have class because they know etiquette and humility.Are strong because they are cautious, respectful and do not make mistakes.Have a good time their entire lives because they choose their words carefully."},{"title":"Is the Sun Closer or Further?","content":"Confucius was strolling in the open field. He ran into two kids who were arguing adamantly with each other.​One claimed that the sun was closer to the earth at sunrise and further from it at noon. The other maintained just the very opposite.      The first kid justified his position by maintaining that at sunrise the sun was as big as the wheel of a cart while it was only the size of a bowl at noon time.The second kid argued that at sunrise the sun felt cool therefore it had to be further from earth whereas the sun felt hot at noon and therefore it had to be closer.As they turned to Confucius for arbitrage, the wise man could not help.So the two kids laughed aloud and said: “And they say that you have wisdom?”Confucius smiled and strolled on.* * * * *No one can live long enough to learn everything because knowledge is boundless. Even the wisest amongst us such as the sages and Bodhisattvas cannot know everything.Therefore, the truly wise are humble and never think that they are better than others. Moreover, the sages would never waste time in arguing or proving that they are right.​Real wisdom is in being able to accept another’s wrong opinion as right."},{"title":"Racism","content":"​There was a family that raised pigs for profit.​They had a black swine that gave birth to three piglets. Two were black and one was black with white areas like a Dalmatian. The mother swine took great care of the two pitch black offspring. In contrast, she mistreated her black and white piglet and eventually even bit it to death.   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t       Isn’t that a common behavior among mankind? When we share the same beliefs, the same race, the same skin color, the same religion, the same aspirations then we like and support each other. Or else, we often give rise to suspicion, jealousy and hatred.​People of virtue would never love or hate based on form or shape; or unite or segregate based on beliefs. Nor would they consider one as a friend because they are the same and label someone else as a foe because they are different. Even when the others do not share the same blood, race, work or belief as us, we should still love and support them. That is called being human."},{"title":"I Voted","content":"​One of my disciples asked me who to vote for on the upcoming election.I explained that under the current circumstances, it was better to vote for such and such candidates.​However, I also explained that I have not voted for a long time because of the following reasons:      I no longer participate in or discuss politics. I believe in a clear separation of Church and State and therefore, religious leaders should in no way influence politics.People often sarcastically say that it is about voting for the lesser of two evils. Be it as it may, I feel that I should not vote for any evil at all.I have a hard time voting for a person who knowingly misleads people no matter how well-intentioned he or she is.I will only vote for a virtuous candidate.Finally, I prefer not to vote so as to nurture a non-discriminating mind."},{"title":"4 Reasons for Seeking a Good Knowing Adviser","content":"​One of the first lessons that I learned from my late teacher, Great Master Xuan Hua, was to constantly look and draw near Good Knowing Advisers (GKA).​After practicing Mahayana for 20 years, I am beginning to understand its importance.        I can think of four reasons why it is advantageous to study under a GKA:​Superior GKAs teach superior transcendental methods of practice that ordinary people do not know. They do not hold back and will teach you how quickly certify to the fruitions. Therefore drawing near great GKAs wills save us time and energy.GKAs point out things about yourself that you cannot see. We ordinary people are like standing on the mountain and cannot see it. In particular, great GKAs help us discover our flaws instead of praising our strengths.GKAs secretly provide protection and guidance. Just like secular society needs the police and armed forces to keep all of us safe, GKAs quietly help us in more ways that we can possibly fathom. This is what they do and therefore we should have faith that they all have our best interests at heart.GKAs pave the way for you to continue making progress. They have a roadmap because they have already went through it. Therefore they all pave the way for our continued progress. If you do not already have a GKA, you should pray to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for guidance so that they can direct you to one. When you have enough blessings, you will."},{"title":"Having the Proper Perspective","content":"A visiting ambassador said: “I wish you a long life.”The king replied: “Please don’t say that!”​The ambassador then said: “I wish you much wealth.”      The king replied: “Please don’t say that!”The ambassador then said: “I wish you many male offspring.”The king replied: “Please don’t say that!”The ambassador inquired: “Those are what most the people want. Why don’t you?”The king said: “To have many princes only creates more worries, to be wealthy creates more work and to have a long life only increases criticism. They only bring more suffering. That is why I do not find them desirable.”* * * * *This king is quite wise. He is not greedy and therefore has less suffering. He symbolizes the Sound-Hearers who have realized transcendental wisdom.* * * * *Then the ambassador told the king: “You think like a superior monarch. However, men are born in order to carry out tasks. If you have more princes then you just give them more tasks. What is there to be afraid of? Furthermore, if you are wealthy and can share it with others, what additional work is there? Finally, when you can sleep and eat in moderation, your mind is constantly at ease. When the world is good then you share your goodness with them and when the world is bad then you rectify them so that they become good and solidify. And lastly when your time comes to an end, you leave behind a better world and go to an even better place: how can you possibly fear criticism?”The ambassador then immediately returned to his country.

For every three men who work in the field that Confucius met, he could learn from two of them! Or, of every three women who are on their way to the supermarket, Confucius could also learn from two of them. Of course, it is also the case that of three kids on their way to the mall, Confucius could still learn from two of them.Honestly, this baffled me for a decade: how can one person have so much wisdom? So I meditated and meditated until one day, my master told me to start teaching.I immediately resisted the idea. First of all, I was in seclusion and was enjoying the Chan bliss: the idea of going back to the real world where chaos and noise reign did not appeal to me. Furthermore, I was not sure that I had anything as profound as my teacher’s teachings to add to the Mahayana knowledge of this country.But I knew better than to disobey my master’s instructions.So I started teaching while hoping that perhaps through my work I too will be able to encounter good teachers like Confucius did.I first started to teach Chan. Then I began to lecture on sutras. Then came Pure Land. Then came Tantric.There are quite a few students who make you feel good about your work. They are respectful because you represent the Triple Jewel. They enjoy learning the teaching because it helps improve their lives. They are grateful for the training because it helps improve their health and well-being.Then there are quite a few who make you wonder. They only talk the talk but are not willing to walk the walk. They want shortcuts and expect you to do all the work for them.Some come to the temple more to find fault in others, especially from their teachers. They say that they are grateful to you for “saving their lives” and then they slander you and stab you in the back because you ruffle their ego.Honestly, I often wondered why I bothered with these people. You can spot them a mile away: they have a frown on their face, an air of contempt as if they are doing you a favor for coming to the temple and they love to gossip and comment on the sanghans’ faults.But one day it dawned on me why my late teacher told me to start teaching. It was because I had to work on my compassion. The fact that I disliked ungrateful students is because I lacked compassion for them. They are suffering enough without my having to condemn them.You probably have people in your life who also cause you problems. Believe it or not, they are actually helping us. They are teaching us about our lack of compassion for certain types of people. Because of them, we have the opportunity to work on making our compassionate heart grow. Without learning this lesson we could never become Buddhas.With this realization, I became immensely grateful to my late teacher. I have been such a selfish and ungrateful student and yet he patiently continued to teach me.That is why I resolved to teach the Five Schools of Buddhism that he brought to America.Yes, I still often wonder why I have to continue to put up with some ungrateful students. But at the same time, I am grateful to them for helping me work on my compassion.​I often wake up every day feeling good about my life as a monk because it is a great blessing to be able to live a pure and simple life. And now, I am learning to be more humble and I look at every three men (and women and children as well) as my teachers."},{"title":"Why We Cultivate the Proper Dharma","content":"Life is a struggle between Good and Evil. In this Dharma Ending Era, the ghosts and demons are proliferating and prevailing over the good and sagely.Ghosts and demons are in the destruction business: they aim to create havoc and destroy the world as we know it. Ironically, they will eventually succeed in their endeavors which will result in their own destruction.       The Buddha says that as long as there are people who cultivate the Proper Dharma, the ghosts and demons will be kept in check. To this end, the Buddhist left home people recite the Shurangama Mantra every day because it said that as long as one person can recite this Mantra, the ghosts and demons will behave. The Mantra can subdue all demonic forces and thus protect the ghosts and demons from themselves.Cultivators of Mahayana radiate a positive energy and can emit a bright light of wisdom that will chase away the forces of darkness. Therefore, the Triple Jewel should be revered and protected because they are doing a lot more good than they would ever want to take credit for. This is how you can become Buddhas: by giving to and helping others and not wishing to take credit for your good deeds.​If you really understand this, you would never think that left home people are irresponsible because they shirk their responsibilities to society. Nothing could be further from the truth."},{"title":"Monk at work","content":"Traditionally, in larger Way places, there is a monk or nun designated as Kitchen manager or Food and Drink manager, 點坐法師. Those who wish to make food and drink offerings to the temple must go see him. He accepts all such offerings and disburses them to the kitchen staff for cooking.Quite often, the temple cannot use up the food offerings quickly enough. Therefore, the Kitchen manager would often ask for a formal procedure called karmavachana through which he formally requests permission from his “bosses” to redirect the food and drink usage, say by donating it to other temples.       You see, people in the know are very careful about managing properly the resources of the Way place, by following the proper procedures. Why? Failure to do so is to commit offenses against the Triple Jewel. And that would carry very grave consequences.For example, the abbess of a temple cannot say that she wants to donate her temple to her monk son because she loves him. That would probably mean improper management of the resources of the temple. On the other hand, can a monk son say that he accepts such donation out of love for his mother? That would be an even worse offense unless he decides to accept the donation on behalf of the Triple Jewel.Make no mistake about it. Once anything is accepted on behalf of the Triple Jewel, then it must be managed accordingly because after all, all sanghans are just representatives of the Triple Jewel and are supposed to not treat them as personal properties. I repeat, even the head monk, who has the final saying over the temple matters, he must go through the proper procedures in order to ensure the proper deployment of the Triple Jewel resources, if he has enough wisdom.The question arises about the case of some left home people who go to work. They then bring home the paycheck to pay for the mortgage on the temple property and the bills. Can they do as they please?It depends on the individual sanghan.Some feel that they can.Unfortunately, that is not the case.The proper procedure would be to first offer up the paycheck to the Triple Jewel. Once received, then the abbot who holds a job must then manage the offering on behalf of the Triple Jewel and cannot certainly do as he pleases.Those abbots who choose to do as they please will eventually run into trouble. They do not last very long if they intentionally commit offenses against the Triple Jewel that they are supposed to serve.We do not need to do anything. There is no need to worry. We all get what we deserve. Such is the law of Cause and Effect.For example, some very smart and informed Buddhists may criticize the abbot of a temple for wasting the resources of the temple by offering to pay for his entourage’s expenses to a trip to Hawaii for Dharma propagation. That is quite misguided to comment the abbot’s motives. Who are they to feel qualified to comment on how the Triple Jewel resources should be used? Did they go through the decades of training before one becomes an abbot? Aren’t they even aware that they are not supposed to gossip and question the abbot’s decisions? Those who understand could say that before they make such comments, perhaps they would be more credible if they offer to pay for the Dharma propagation expenses incurred before they may feel qualified to comment on its use.Finally, in my humble opinion, if I do not feel that sanghans should go to work in order to earn enough to sustain their work as sanghans. We become left home people in order to devote our lives to transcendental pursuits, not to make money or seek fame or profit. If we are worthy of it, we will receive enough support without having to ask for it. If we don’t then perhaps we should change “profession”.I am very grateful for the support I have been receiving so far in all these decades of full time practice as a monk. Thanks to your most generous donations, we never had to owe money to anyone or ask for money to print sutras or pay for gas or pay for our clothes.I will make you this promise. When the support runs out, I will simply return to lay life or disappear into the mountains so that I can devote the rest of my life to do Chan meditation.​Peace and bliss to the world."},{"title":"Dealing with Evil People","content":"During the past several years of teaching, I have had the opportunity to encounter all sorts of people. In particular, I’ve met three very evil people: two women and one man. How do you recognize them?      By their actions: They are out to hurt others. In particular, they are most persuasive in making up excuses to justify their destructive behavior. The most deplorable aspect is that they feel no remorse at all!How should we deal with them?We should do nothing. Within Buddhism, the Buddha has already taught us monks how to deal with “evil Bhikshus”: Simply ignore, do not talk to them. Leave them alone; they will leave by themselves.Can you see the wisdom in the Buddha’s advice?Evil people are very destructive. Just stay away from them and they will eventually destroy themselves without our help.​Consequently, monks who rally others to “evict and punish” bad elements of society should reconsider their actions. Such behavior is deplorable because they go against the Buddha’s teaching and damage our compassionate nature."},{"title":"The Shakyamuni Sharira (Relic) Collection","content":"​During the 2012 year-end Chan Qi (meditation retreat) a man came for one full week. He practiced vigorously and because of his sincere effort, he received many spiritual, physical and emotional benefits. Therefore in gratitude, he offered his collection of 10,000 Shakyamuni shariras to the temple. He had been collecting shariras for several years.       So, on Monday January 21, 2013, I led a small delegation to Oakland to pick up the shariras and brought them back to the temple.A few people who have heard of the gift questioned its authenticity. I replied, if the collection is real then the Mahayana Dharma Protectors will come forth to donate funds to build a magnificent stupa to house it and for the entire country to come and pray.Those who are very sincere will obtain a response to their prayers.I have already observed a few responses from those who come to the temple on a regular basis. Most of them are not even aware of its presence here because I have yet to make an announcement.For example, many of the older ladies who come to our temple for our weekend services feel invigorated. This is because the presence of the shariras creates an exceptionally powerful positive force field. Those who have developed some gongfu will eventually notice that it is much easier to concentrate and enter samadhi while at the temple than at home.In particular, there is a sweet older Chinese lady who very rarely speaks. When she occasionally attends temple on Sunday, she would quietly sit on a bench and listen to the Dharma Talk and would then leave by lunch time. Many times if she ate lunch with us, she would not talk to anyone. And yet, last Sunday, she looked effervescent and happier than usual. And boy did she talk to her neighbors at the lunch table!Today, my disciple brought her six-year old son to the temple. This young boy is not a stranger to the Emergency Room as he has had other medical problems. The boy complained of pain in his heart. His mother decided to bring him to the temple for lunch to observe his condition before taking him to the hospital. The boy appeared to be uncomfortable and had a scowl on his face when he was given food. But half an hour later, he was running around the temple grounds. Apparently whatever bothered him cleared up in no time, so they went home.One of my Western disciples inquired about the authenticity of the shariras. I told her that my opinion carried little weight. Ultimately what matters are the responses that people will receive when they come to request a son or daughter, healing for their illnesses, relief for their traumas and anxieties, etc… I am sure that more people will share their experiences as time goes by.​I was told that the ghosts and spirits will come and bow to the shariras and consequently will obtain immediate liberation (immediately give up their ghost or spirit existence and obtain rebirth to a higher realm of existence). How do they know of the presence of the shariras? They can see the wondrous light emanating from them. You too will be able to see their brilliance, once you cultivate more vigorously and purify your heart."},{"title":"Two Kinds of Teachers","content":"There was a Caucasian Chan student who took refuge with a Japanese Zen master. He came to our temple in order to learn more about Mahayana. He was well-educated and wished to devote his life to Buddhism to help others. He planned to follow the Japanese tradition of new Sangha where left-home people can marry and have a family.      ​I suggested that he consider leaving the home life and devote his life to learn Mahayana. In summary here are the reasons I gave. I told him that there are two kinds of teachers:There are those who know they are confused but insist on teaching and helping others. These teachers are simply teaching for selfish reasons because in reality, they are not furthering their students’ spiritual development. Their followers would have no choice but to continue revolving on the Reincarnation Wheel.Then there are those who know they are confused and therefore refrain from guiding others. They choose not to teach until they fully understand the Way to Liberation. Only then can they truly help.After thorough consideration, the young Chan student decided to leave the home life and train with us. For Mahayana to prosper in the West, we need more of these dedicated individuals."},{"title":"The Limitations of Science","content":"​In the past, I have received a lot of questions on the scientific proof of Buddhism. I am no scientist and therefore I can only offer the following limited view.Science continues to evolve; therefore it still does not know everything. ​For example, there are some Nobel of Science laureates who believe in God, spirits, etc. In contrast, there are also some others who would say that such beliefs are sheer nonsense. ​       In general, scientific knowledge is confined to the domain of validating their hypotheses. Case in point, Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was initially refuted by scientists and was not fully accepted until decades later, when the field of science had evolved to a level where it could prove this theory through empirical evidence.I choose to believe in The Buddha’s explanations because his domain is this entire universe. With his Buddha Eye, there is nothing he cannot see and therefore he does not have the limitations like those found in science. For instance, scientists have yet to understand the inner working of the mind and they never will. This is because their discovery is still based on their limited sense organs.Therefore, the Buddhist should rely on science if it is within their domain. Otherwise, it is better to put faith in those who have true Wisdom and infallible Knowledge."},{"title":"Chan Can Control Cholesterol Level","content":"​Tam has been taking prescription medicine to lower his cholesterol, everyday, since 2008. During our one month Chan Meditation retreat, he decided not to take his pills, since he would be eating a simple vegetarian diet and meditating all day. ​During the Chan retreat, he felt his health was getting better and better every day.About six weeks later, Tam still had not taken any of his cholesterol pills. He thought that maybe he should start taking them again.    \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t       So one night, at about 10pm, he took one pill before bed. About half an hour later, his entire body suddenly began to itch. He tried to fall asleep, but the itching was too intense. So at about 12am, he got up and began to meditate. After sitting for about 30 minutes, the itching dramatically decreased, and he was able to lie down and sleep.When he reported his experience during a Dharma Talk a month later, our teacher, Dharma Master YongHua explained that Tam made giant strides during the Chan Qi, and reached the upper tiers of the formless realm samadhis. When he took the pill after the Chan Qi, due to his skill level, his body naturally rejected the toxins contained in the cholesterol medicine, which is why his body became itchy. When he decided to meditate for half an hour, that’s when he was able to get rid of most of the toxins from the pills.Thus we can see that, due to his formless realm samadhi, Tam was able to regulate his cholesterol level without any medicine. Since that day, he has no longer been taking any cholesterol pills."},{"title":"Mind of a Bodhisattva","content":"Last week, we went in search of a print shop to print the “Chan Handbook.”​This time, a Buddhist disciple brought us to a place in Santa Ana. She has been printing Buddhist books on her own for 17 years, ever since she came to the United States. She owns a nail shop and when she earns enough money she spends it on printing these books.      It hasn’t been easy. The last time she tried to find a print shop, she was so dissatisfied and incensed with the owner that after leaving, she implored Guan Yin Bodhisattva to help find her a better one. As she drove on, she stumbled on to a small print shop. She went in to inquire and was surprised to get a quote that was half the price she usually paid. She then requested help in revising the cover and the owner agreed. I commented, “That is strange! If I were asked to print only 20-30 copies, not only would I decline, I certainly would not help you with the cover!” She said, “That is why I think that Guan Yin helped me! Last night, I called him and he gave me a quote for your book. I feel that it is a pretty good price but please don’t worry, we’ll haggle some more.”We went to the print shop and asked for a quote for 2,000 copies: half in Vietnamese and half in English. The owner quoted us a price that was even 20% lower than what he quoted her the night before.I announced to the six women who accompanied me that his quote is even lower than the price in Vietnam. I then turned to my Chinese disciple and told her: “Go ahead, haggle!” She went: “Uh…Uh…” I then turned to the nail shop owner. “She is speechless! Now it is your turn, haggle! Then it will be my turn.” (This is not true: my monk precepts forbid haggling.) She went: “Uh…Uh…” Everyone laughed out aloud because no one would dare haggle with this generous and humble man.To tell you the truth, I was even prepared to pay higher because I like the print shop owner. He is at Third Dhyana. He is very gentle and kind to women, and he is not a predator like many small business owners I have met. Clearly, he wants to help others do good works, such as printing Buddhist books. That was why he helped the nail shop owner. Isn’t that foolish? Not at all. He has the mind of a Bodhisattva like Guan Yin: he wishes to help others do good whether they are grateful or not. If I spend a little bit more money, it will alleviate pressure on him and then hopefully he will be able to take on more small projects.In the end, I insisted that the women to put one thousand dollars down for a deposit because they were prepared to walk away and the print shop owner would not have asked for it either. This time, we spent thousands of dollars but everyone was happy: the women were glad that we could print books at an affordable price, and the husband and wife owners were happy to be of service to a group of Buddhists who were reasonable and who did not take advantage of their kindness.​Buddhist disciples should really live our ideals: we should do the right thing and be willing to take a loss. If we always insist on gaining fame and benefit in everything we do, are we not then creating suffering for others?"},{"title":"The Practical Benefits of Chan Meditation","content":"​“For the rest of your life, remember this: when you are in trouble or have some big problem, or you are tired or confused, cross your legs, close your eyes, and recite the Buddha’s name and the problem will eventually take care of itself.”– Master YongHua   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t       Laura-Elena’s Samadhi Lesson: How to Stop a Coughing AttackTaken from Master YongHua’s Dharma Talk on July 6, 2013Recently at one our Chan classes, one of our younger students shared with us her most amazing discovery. Laura-Elena, who is 10 years old, taught all of us how to stop a coughing attack using Chan meditation skills.Laura-Elena was sick a couple of weeks ago. She couldn’t stop coughing. It started around midnight and she was coughing violently. Her family didn’t know what was causing it because her nose wasn’t clogged or running. She was coughing from her lungs and it hurt. A lot!She was coughing for about 2 hours non-stop. During that time her mom tried everything parents would normally do: over the counter medication, tea with honey, even vinegar, but nothing helped. After a while there was nothing left to do but to take Laura-Elena to Emergency. That’s when her mom who practiced Chan under Master YongHua went to her and said that she might have to go to the hospital. But before doing that, her mother suggested that they try different things. She asked Laura-Elena if she would like to meditate. If she was able to meditate the coughing might stop. Her mom suggested to take the coughing out of her mind, don’t focus on it so much. Right away, Laura-Elena started her meditation. The young lady went to Master YongHua’s Chan class a few times already and therefore knew what to do.She sat in full lotus position on the floor and recited the Buddha’s name to her navel. In the beginning it was hard to concentrate because she had to fight the impulse to cough. However, eventually she relaxed. Laura-Elena says she doesn’t remember what happened but 5 minutes after she started meditating, the coughing was a lot more bearable. She then continued to sit for 15 minutes during which she lost track of time. Then she got up from the floor. Her mother said that Laura-Elena didn’t say a word to her. She simply got up from the floor, climbed into bed and went to sleep.Her mother said that during her coughing fit, Laura-Elena went to the bathroom and was trying to vomit. When you feel like you want to vomit, that means that your qi is moving in the wrong direction. That’s when you definitely need to meditate. Meditation regulates the qi flow. When the qi is flowing as it should, you don’t want to vomit.When you are sick, weak and tired like this, the temptation is to lie down and rest. Doctors tell you to do that. But if you have Chan skills the best thing for you to do is to meditate. It’s a struggle when you first meditate when you don’t feel well. But the point is to keep at it. You fight your tiredness; keep concentrating on your meditation. This is where your Chan skills will pay off and help you. This is the quickest way to recover.When you don’t have any Chan skills and you don’t feel well and try to meditate to help yourself, nothing happens. But if you have Chan skills and you are sick or drained, it will be very easy to enter samadhi. That’s what happened to Laura-Elena. She sat there for 15 minutes in samadhi. During this time, the qi was very strong and was flowing through her lungs and her whole body, so by the time that she exited samadhi, the qi had already healed her. That’s why she stopped coughing. This is how she was able to heal herself.This is why we meditate every day. We hone our meditation skills so when you get sick, these skills can help you recover.When her mother suggested for her to meditate, Laura-Elena took her advice. Instead of discounting and ignoring her mother, she listened to her. This showed that she already had a lot of blessings. If she didn’t, they would have gone to Emergency, and then every time she had a coughing attack she would have to go to Emergency again; a pattern would already be set. But going to the hospital would only take care of the coughing, whereas the Chan meditation took care of the cause.You could look at the coughing attack as something bad that happened. But you could also look at it as a blessing in disguise because through this experience Laura-Elena discovered that she has some Chan skills that she can depend on when she is in trouble.​Enter Samadhi and heal yourself. You ought to take your Chan practice seriously because it’s your well being that’s at sake. You are improving your well-being when you improve your Chan skills."},{"title":"2nd Report on the Summer Chan Qi 2013","content":"When I first started to practice meditation, I desperately wanted to enter First Dhyana because I realized that it was a critical milestone. I researched and tried everything but was not able, as I found out many years later, to enter First Dhyana until after two years of practice.      So far during this Chan Qi, people have been entering samadhis left and right.There was a young lady from San Jose who is a nurse. She tagged along with her friend to the Chan Qi for a week without taking it very seriously. However, after listening to the Dharma instructions during the first two evening lectures, she began to take it seriously. And within five days, she reached First Dhyana even though she never meditated before. She was a picture and serenity and happiness. She said that she never felt “this great ever!”Then there was a Hispanic lady who purchased our Chan Handbook. She wanted to learn Chan because “it is good for me” she said. After one week of practice, during which she could barely follow one third of our sits, she entered First Dhyana too. She just told me: “I felt good. My head is like stone.” I said: “I am sure the stones in Mexico are the same as here. They are very heavy and dense. Do you mean that your head feels so light and clear?” She smiled from ear to ear and replied: “Yes, there is nothing inside.” [All the worries that tormented her when she first started were gone].I am not sure why there are so many wonderful responses. Maybe the participants are very special, or it’s the water, or the food that is cooked with so much care and kindness from our volunteers?"},{"title":"On Generosity","content":"Yielding​I recently met someone who’s considering to donate a Guan Yin statue, a 12 foot tall Guan Yin statue to our temple.  And it’s interesting because of her unique situation. ​When I asked her why was she thinking of doing this, she said, “I prayed to Guan Yin when I was in trouble.  I received her help so now I want to donate a statue to show my gratitude.”      She had a liver transplant. It went so well and so smoothly that she made sizable donations in honor of Guan Yin Bodhisattva and Amitabha Buddha. It’s a beautiful statue of Guan Yin sitting on a dragon. It was carved in Vietnam and it’s breath-taking. So I said, “That’s very commendable that you wish to make this donation. I’m hoping that the merit and virtue you will receive will enable you to reduce the medications you are taking.” She takes about 20 pills a day and most of them will be for the rest of her life.You may be surprised by the next thing I told her. I suggested that she donate this spectacular statue to a bigger temple because of the greater blessings she will obtain. We are a small temple and we aren’t worthy of such a generous donation. Additionally there aren’t many people who come, so she’s better off donating it to a bigger temple where more blessings will accrue. The statue will be seen by many more people and Guan Yin Bodhisattva will be able to reach more people in need.Contrary to what you might think, this is the best decision for all concerned. It’s to her benefit that she gives it to a bigger temple. In comparison, we are a minor temple with a small following. We need to keep our greed in check and focus on humility and our commitment to cultivate. You see, this is what we do. This is the spirit of what my teachers taught their disciples. It’s very Chinese and it’s very Buddhist. We need to yield to benefit others. Cultivation is not about benefiting yourself, not at all. Terrified of Being WrongOne of my disciples came to talk to me. “Yesterday I revealed a secret to someone,” she said “but I don’t remember who I told!” There are two fears here. There’s the fear of exposing one’s faults to someone who perhaps might not be discreet. The other is the greater of the two, the fear of the secret itself. She made a decision that will affect her son. I said, “All of us have this secret fear; we’re terrified of being wrong. You don’t want your son to think you made the wrong choice.” We make so many important decisions for our children that will affect their future. We dare not make a mistake.It’s frightening to be wrong because you’ll lose face. That is a common fear among Asians but it’s not just Asians that feel this way.  We all do. In particular we worry that we’ve lost the respect of our loved ones.It’s my secret fear too.It’s our common secret.And the people of the world disguise their fear by making sure they get ahead: they go for profit. Because when you gain money, fame or power, how can you be wrong?Taking a Loss to Benefit OthersWhen I was in the business world, I was paranoid about staying competitive and achieving success. I used to think that every action I took had to benefit me in some way. Otherwise, I thought, people would laugh at me because they would see me as a failure. Back then I was so worldly but in reality, I was unbelievably ignorant. After I became a monk and started propagating the Dharma, I found myself doing exactly the opposite. Rather than thinking of myself and personal benefits, I now prefer to take a loss to benefit others.When I’m faced with a problem and if it’s the right thing to do, I ask myself, am I prepared to “take a loss?” Someone is bound to. Everyone is out to gain, to benefit, and to profit. But the flip side is someone else is going to fail.I try to follow the example of my Chinese Master and the patriarchs. They taught their students by their actions and they preferred to take losses. They were never about personal gain and benefit. When you practice giving then automatically it means that you lose in some way, either personally, emotionally, or financially.Some people are confused as to what exactly is giving, so let me explain. If you give something away that you don’t like, that’s not true giving. That kind of giving is the same as when you donate old clothes to charity: you don’t really want them anymore. But let’s say you love your car, or you cherish a piece of jewelry or your home, or choose an amount of money that’s more than you would ever want to spend, and you decide to give that away. That’s true giving because it matters to you. When you practice this kind of giving you will experience a bigger loss, and that’s the spirit of giving that I’m talking about. It is more meritorious when it hurts a little bit.There is something worth emulating in Great Master Xuan Hua’s decision to eat one meal a day so that his left home people wouldn’t compete with lay people for their scant meals, or his decision to not ask for donations so his left home peers would find success. We too should live a simple and humble life and not indulge ourselves or seek fame.By spreading and sharing losses with others you are making life more pleasant for everyone around you. When you are constantly thinking and plotting for your own benefit, believe me, you are so unkind! To always be the winner skews your personality and your outlook on life. If we are the only ones benefiting, then those close to us are most likely the ones who are suffering and as a result, life is very hard for them.  So my attitude is, let me take a loss to make life more satisfying for the people around me.I hope that more of you will adopt this attitude where you deliberately opt to lose so that others can benefit. In doing so you are becoming more compassionate and are making your community a better place. If you are thinking this is completely unfair, you are absolutely right!  I’m sure you will hear others say “If you are like that people will take advantage of you.” If you enjoy helping others, then you won’t mind. But if you don’t, maybe you can try this approach: Think that you owe them (they helped you in a previous life) and therefore you should pay up. On Letting Go When you let go, it’s all or nothing.When you let go, you are letting go of all of your attachments. Let’s say you are being generous to someone. Maybe this person is taking advantage of you.  What I’m asking you to do is for you to continue being generous. The reason is because in the process of giving you are letting go of your attachment to money. Don’t worry if they are taking advantage of you. Concentrate on learning to be more generous. That way, they can no longer afflict you.It’s unpleasant to be played for a fool. The common approach would be to stop, but that’s the wrong attitude. Instead, you should say “go ahead”. You know they are taking advantage of you and you still give in. That’s generosity. Who’s the winner? You are, because you are being virtuous. ​You never lose when you choose to give.And if they don’t appreciate it, then shame on them. Instead of judging them, you should pity them and continue to be generous. The PatsyYou are so kind and so good that people step all over you and take advantage of you. The more you give, the more they take. “Is that all you’ve got?” they ask. “Why are you so stingy?”When you are able to give it’s not a problem. But there will come a time that you’ll be at the end of your rope. You will have nothing left and they will still expect a hand out. The next time they ask, this is your chance to teach. Tell them that they are being too greedy and unreasonable, that they don’t deserve your generosity and then you do the unexpected: you stop giving.Give until you no longer can. That’s how generous we should learn to become. Give until it’s time to stop. At WorkSomeone asked what if they keep taking advantage of you at work, when do you stop?​I submit to you: you don’t stop. When you stop prematurely, you will not unfold your wisdom.* * * * *The moral of the story is: To be generous, one should learn to give completely. One should learn to give it all. Please learn to let go. That is self-mastery. That is truer happiness."},{"title":"Living in the Moment: From the Mahayana Perspective","content":"I often hear people advocate that one must learn to “live in the moment”, “live in the here and now,” “live in the present” or similar expressions. Usually, it’s in the context of meditation. I have heard many interpretations of these phrases but have not been satisfied with any, so I would like to give you my thoughts from the Mahayana perspective.      First of all, the recommendation to “live in the moment” is meant to remind us that we should not be scattered. We are constantly “false thinking”: that is, we cannot stop thinking. We may be eating some delicious ice cream but by the force of habit, we might be thinking about work. Some might consider “multi-tasking” to be a positive or a necessity. But the true meditation practitioner considers this constant mental processing a negative, a symptom of being scattered. It is undesirable because we have no control over our thoughts. That is why meditation teachers remind us to live in the present. ​Learn to reduce false thinking by concentrating on the task at hand; do not allow your mind to wander.It is important to recognize that our minds like to false think about the past or future instead of focusing on the present. When we delight in the memories of our childhood or are consumed with worries about our family or our job, aren’t we neglecting the present? Therefore, it is better to re-train our minds to concentrate on the present as long as we must think.Let’s delve a little deeper. “Living in the here and now” gives us more details. “Here” provides the space dimension while “now” provides the time dimension.Here means the very place where we are. We should be aware of where we physically are or the specific environment we are in. If you ask the Mahayana practitioner, he would explain to you that at a deeper level, here really means your body; the innermost layer of your sensory perception. Those with true skills in Mahayana meditation will point out the need to remain within and not go chasing outside after forms, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch and things. Then you are living here, in your body.Now refers to the present moment in time. Actually, it does not exist because it belongs to the past. As soon as we speak of the now, it has already become the past. We really can’t bring up the future to catch the present because the future has not yet arrived. This is what is referred to in the Vajra Sutra as: “The past cannot be obtained, the present cannot be obtained and the future cannot be obtained.”In the context of here and now, it is suffice to say that “now” alludes to the importance of cherishing the moment. Let’s cherish life while we still can. And I’d like to add: live right by doing the right things and not self-indulge so much. Furthermore, we cannot afford to be too short-sighted and only consider this lifetime. We must create the good karmas and avoid creating the bad ones because the actions and choices of this lifetime will affect the next. That is the Mahayana spirit of living in the now. Do good so that you create the positive causes to ascend and elevate ourselves from our selfishness and pettiness to a higher level of being.Finally, “to live in the here” is to be considerate to our environment. Help improve it instead of exploiting it for only our own benefit. “To live in the now” is to be considerate of others. Let’s resolve to be good and pleasant instead of plotting for our own advantages and pleasures."},{"title":"Heeding Advice","content":"Once upon a time the Buddha was born into a wealthy family. As he became of age, he saw how from passion springs pain and how true bliss comes by the abandonment of passion. So he decided to distance himself from desires: He left the home life and went to the Himalayas to become a hermit. ​      He gradually reached higher planes of attainment. With time he came to have a large following of five hundred hermits.One day a young poisonous viper wandered into the hut of one of the hermits. That cultivator developed a liking for the creature. He treated it as his own child, housing it in a piece of bamboo and bestowed kindness to it.Hearing that one of the hermits was keeping a viper, the Buddha sent for him and said, “A viper can never be trusted. Get rid of it.”“But,” supplicated the hermit, “my viper is dear to me as a pupil to a teacher; I cannot live without him.”“Well then,” answered the Buddha, “be forewarned that you will lose your life because of it.”Unmindful of the master’s warning, that hermit still kept the pet he could not bear to part with. Barely a few days later, all the hermits went out to gather fruit. Coming to a spot where all kinds of produce grew in plenty, they stayed there longer than they intended. And along with them went our hermit leaving his viper behind in its bamboo prison. When they came back two or three days later, he wanted to feed the creature. He opened the cage, stretched out his hand, saying, “Come, my son; you must be hungry.” But angered with its long fast, the viper bit his outstretched hand, killing him on the spot, and escaped into the forest.This story illustrates something that I am beginning to understand through my several years of teaching Mahayana. I’ve tried to take on students who are very difficult to teach, hoping that the Dharma will change them. I am coming to the realization that they can’t be helped after all, perhaps because just like the young viper, they are not really interested in cultivation in spite of their claims. Not only are they unwilling to turn from evil toward goodness, they never hesitate to hurt those around them when they get afflicted. It’s just too bad that they did not gain much from the Dharma while many of us benefited greatly by enduring their evil.Finally, we should remind ourselves to heed the words of our wise advisers or sages, especially when their words are not what we want to hear."},{"title":"One Weight Loss Strategy","content":"​One very effective way to lose weight is to meditate, but not with just any kind of meditation! Meditate with the expressed purpose of increasing your self-awareness.​You are overweight because you eat excessively. You eat excessively because you have triggers that compel you to consume food and drink. Recognize those triggers and then half of the problem will be solved.       For example, one such trigger is anger. Another one is being unhappy. And yet another one is being depressed. I used to know a twenty-something lady who, when depressed, would grab a box of cereal, retire to a quiet place and load up on carbohydrates. One major cause is feeling bad. When we feel bad, food provides us comfort which can be addictive. Make a list of those triggers so that you can spot them quickly. The quicker you can recognize them, the easier it is to neutralize them.The other half of the solution is to resist the temptation to eat until it passes.​Again, meditation skills can be very helpful because good meditators learn to become more patient and therefore are better equipped to “wait” until the urge to eat “blows” over.Of course, if you insist on being self-indulgent, then never mind; nothing can help!"},{"title":"Report on Chan Qi 2012 – 2013","content":"Last month, we had our annual year-end Chan Meditation Retreat (Chan Qi). We decided to hold it for a month’s time instead of the usual one-week retreat as in prior years. We particularly welcomed the opportunity to participate and work on our gongfu after a very busy 2012.      This year, fewer people participated but we obtained many more responses than before.For example, people from over ten nationalities participated, turning our temple into a more international congregation.​While not everyone could meditate every day from 3am until midnight, those who could attend joined the Assembly for one or two sits at a time. Several came most nights specifically to listen to the Dharma Talks and to have their questions answered. And still others volunteered their time to do chores around the temple although they were tired from cultivating, in order to support the Chan Qi.On the last day, we provided a report on our Chan Qi experience during our celebratory luncheon and asked a few participants to express their thoughts. Again, there were numerous wonderful responses this year. Many meditators found that their gongfu increased to the next samadhi level although they only came part-time. There was even a participant who cleared out his lungs of a problem that he has had for the last fifteen years but the doctors could not find anything wrong. Please listen to the closing Dharma Talk of our Chan Qi on this audio mp3 file on our web site for more details.Chan Qi is a very powerful Mahayana meditation practice.  We followed the same methodology as practiced by the Patriarchs of old and as a result, we received significant help in order to unfold our inherent wisdom and obtain peace and bliss. From now on, we will organize these one-month Chan retreats more often. The next one will begin on the last week of May and we cordially invite all of you to come and participate however much you can.In particular, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Dharma Protectors and supporters who worked very hard and diligently so that we would be able to practice in peace. For example, during the Chan Qi we did not hear a police car’s siren even once when we typically hear them every fortnight in our neighborhood.After the Chan Qi, all the participants were very happy and full of Dharma bliss.We also wish you a New Year full of Dharma bliss and that you will find success in all your endeavors."},{"title":"Introducing a New Novice Monk: Ven. Xian Jie","content":"I met Xian Jie, AKA Thomas Meier, at the Hsi Lai Temple in Los Angeles a few years ago. That day, I stopped by the temple to have lunch because it is one of the few rare places in Los Angeles where one can have vegetarian lunch that is free of onion and garlic. It is also worth noting that the temple is most generous in letting us left-home people eat free of charge.   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t       After I got my plate of food, I sat down in the lunch hall to eat. I purposely put on the iPod earphones that one of my students offered me so I would be left alone. Half way through my meal, a young Caucasian male sat opposite the table from me and started talking to me. That was Thomas.​He was very polite and respectful. He told me that he was on his way to his Zen teacher’s temple in the mountains.Thomas was working on his PhD in Philosophy at the University of California in Irvine and he had been practicing meditation for ten years. I immediately asked, “Then how come you are still at zero samadhi?” He asked, “What is samadhi?” I said: “Samadhi refers to your concentration level. How can you practice meditation and not know about samadhi?”Thomas then asked to come to my temple in Rosemead where I was explaining about the samadhi levels during my lecture of the Earth Store Sutra. He came religiously every weekend to practice reciting the Buddha’s name in the morning and then stayed for the Sutra lecture in the afternoon. It took a few months to explain the eight samadhis, during which time Thomas quickly reached Second Dhyana. He used to ask a lot of questions every time I spoke Dharma. His curiosity was really insatiable. His questions were very bright and reflected his sincere desire to learn about Mahayana. When I finished explaining the Eighth level of samadhi, I said that I would not explain about the Ninth level until I explain the Vajra Sutra or formally teach Chan meditation. At that point, Thomas seemed to have gotten what he wanted and vanished.Several months later he came back to ask me for help. He has struggled with bouts of manic depression all his life and once again he found himself in this extremely difficult predicament. In addition, he realized that he learned a lot about Mahayana from my lectures. He read the teachings of my Chinese teacher, Great Master Xuan Hua, so he was considering learning Mahayana from me.I immediately replied that I could not help, so he left.He did not return to the temple for about a year. Eventually he asked for permission to come and participate on our weekend Dharma Assemblies.Several months later, he progressed to higher levels of samadhi and asked to move in to the temple as a volunteer resident.I then explained to him why I had initially turned down his requests for help and for being his teacher. Like most Westerners who want to learn Buddhism, he had the wrong attitude. His message was, “Here I am, teach me!” You can learn Buddhism from books or from a meditation instructor. However, if you want to learn my Mahayana, I must choose to teach you. You have to be taught because it is a gift conferred from a teacher to his chosen student.Thomas can give more detail on his life-long struggle with manic depression. In a nutshell, he found that although medication and counseling helped, the proper environment was also very important. That was why he chose to live for months at a time at his Japanese Zen teacher’s temple. Similarly, Thomas found peace and protection at our small temple. He practiced vigorously and worked tirelessly. Because of our intensive program, Thomas found that he had less time to sleep and rest. In the past, that would have caused more frequent bouts of manic depression. To his surprise, his mental health improved in spite of the increased workload and less time spent on sleep and rest. It’s probably due to a combination of a purer environment, a cleaner diet, protection from Medicine Master Buddha and our Chan and Pure Land Joint Practice.Five months after he came to our temple as a full time volunteer resident, Thomas completely stopped all manic depression medication. By the way, such medications are helpful but tend to have undesirable consequences as our Eastern temple medicine doctor pointed out to him. It has now been almost a year since he stopped taking medication and yet he seems to continue to progress well in his spiritual practice.I am very proud that Thomas decided to formally enter the monastic life as a novice monk under my guidance. Our monk training program is even more rigorous than that for volunteer lay people. Thomas will be faced with many tough challenges in the next two years. I hope that all of you will come forward and support him in his quest for spiritual fulfillment."},{"title":"Two Things We Should Teach Our Children","content":"​Today, my disciple stopped by before going to school, saying that he is starting First Grade. I told him that I was very proud of him (I knew him since he was four and he became my disciple at the age of four or five). I asked him to be a good boy: listen and be respectful to his teachers and not fight with his classmates.       I hope that all the parents will teach their children about the importance of being respectful toward the teachers, especially even when one disagrees with one’s teachers.Furthermore, we should all observe our children’s behavior. When they fight, we should seize the opportunity to teach them to behave civilly (when in disagreement) advise them to learn to yield in order not to hurt others.Now, allow me to emphasize this to my children parents. If your children are disrespectful and like to fight, you should look into your own heart: you will see that most likely, they learned it from you. If you really want to teach your children, you would resolve to be more respectful toward your teachers and elders and yield more often instead of fighting.​Peace and happiness to all."},{"title":"Buddhist Charity","content":"Buddhist charity has four aspects:GivingGenerosityEquanimityMorality      First, there are three kinds of giving:The Giving of Wealth: To give material things such money or things, including one’s own body. This type of giving provides necessities to others to sustain their physical life.The Giving of Dharma: To explain the principles to others and help them understand. This nurtures their wisdom life.The Giving of Fearlessness: To do whatever it takes to dispel others’ fears and anxieties. This sustains faith and restores dignity.Giving is critical to building blessings which will lead one to renounce stinginess and unfold wisdom.The next Buddhist charity is Generosity: To give liberally or repeatedly. Please refer to another Dharma Talk on generosity. Generosity enables us to more effectively detach.Equanimity is the absence of discrimination. We do not discriminate between friend and foe, close and far, good and evil, black and white, etc. We should practice charity with a non- calculating mind. This minimizes jealousy from the receivers’ part and diminishes the ego’s excessive tendency to demand to be in control.The last is Morality: To do no evil and to do only good. This is the basis for all charitable activities. After all, charity is constructive and not destructive, selfless and not egocentric.Ultimately, we should practice charity until “the three wheels are empty”:The Giver: There is no one who is giving. We are no longer attached to giving.The Recipient: There is no one who is receiving. We are no longer attached to the person receiving our charity.The Gift: There is nothing being given. We can detach from our possessions.​At that point, we’ve perfected Buddhist charity. That is liberation. That is true happiness."},{"title":"A Case of Decency","content":"Once upon a time, a long time ago, the Buddha was a merchant of pots and pans. There was also another dealer in the same trade who was a very greedy fellow. They had a friendly agreement: dividing the streets between the two of them, each would set about hawking his wares round the streets of his appointed district.      Now in a certain city there was a family which was in financial ruin. Once they had been a family of rich merchants, but by the time of our story they had lost all of their sons and brothers and all of their wealth. The sole survivors were a girl and her grandmother, and they made their living by working menial jobs. Nevertheless, they had in their house a golden bowl that the great merchant, the head of the family, had used for his meals. It had been long out of use and was covered with grime; therefore the two women did not know that it was made out of gold.​There came to their door the greedy hawker on his round, crying, “Water pots for sale! Water pots for sale!” The girl said to her grandmother, “Oh, do buy me a trinket, Grandma.”“We’re very poor, dear; what can we offer in exchange?”“Why here’s this bowl which is of no good to us. Let’s barter it.”The old woman invited the dealer in and offered him a seat. She gave him the bowl saying, ” Sir, could you be so good as to give my grandchild something in exchange for this?”The greedy hawker took the bowl in his hands, turned it over, and, suspecting it was gold, scratched a line on the back of it with a needle, thereby confirming that it was real gold. Then, thinking that he would get the pot without giving anything whatsoever for it, he cried, “What do you think this is worth? It’s practically worthless!” And then he threw the bowl on the ground, rose up from his seat, and left the house.Now, it had been agreed upon between the two dealers that one might try the streets that the other had already been to. The Buddha merchant came into that same street and appeared at the door of the house, crying, “Water pots for sale!”Once again the girl made the same request of her grandmother and the old woman replied, “My dear, the first hawker threw our bowl on the ground and ran out of the house. What do we have left to offer?”“Oh, that hawker was a harsh-spoken man, Grandma. This one looks like a nice man and speaks kindly. Maybe he would take it.”“Call him in then.”So he came into the house, and they gave him a seat and put the bowl into his hands. Seeing that the bowl was made of gold, he said, “Mother, this bowl is worth a hundred thousand pieces; I don’t have its value with me.”“Sir, the first dealer who came here said that it was practically worthless. He threw it to the ground and went away. It must be the value of your own goodness which has turned the bowl into gold. Take it, give us something for it.”At the time the Buddha had 500 pieces of money and a stock of pots and pans worth just as much. He gave all of it to them saying, “Let me keep my scales, my bag, and a little bit of change for my return boat fare.” And with their consent he took these and the bowl with him and quickly departed to the river where he went home by boat.Subsequently the greedy hawker came back to the house and asked them to bring out their bowl, saying he would give them something for it. But the old woman chided him, “You stated that our golden bowl which is worth a hundred thousand pieces was not worth much. But there came an upright dealer, who gave us a thousand pieces for it and took the bowl away.”Not only did the greedy hawker lose out on the opportunity to make a considerable profit. He also became jealous and full of rage towards his nice competitor and eventually he became a bitter and hateful man.It is refreshing to hear of such decent behavior in people who are motivated by profits. Let’s remind ourselves that treating others fairly and equitably will result in long term trust and profitability. Those who are solely concerned with their own advantage are simply misguided and tend to be very unhappy. They never seem to be able to have enough, no matter how much they own."},{"title":"A Story about Killing Karmas","content":"Once on a time a Brahmin, who was versed in the Three Vedas and world-famed as a teacher, was requested to host a Feast for the Dead. He arranged to have a goat purchased and told his pupils: \"Take this goat down to bathe it in the river. Then feed it with grain, groom it, hang a garland round its neck and bring it back.\"      \"Very good,\" said they, did as ordered and set the animal on the bank.​The goat suddenly became conscious of the deeds of its past lives and was overjoyed at the thought that on this very day it would be freed from all its misery. Thereupon, it laughed aloud.Then at the thought that the Brahmin by slaying it would have to bear misery, the goat felt great compassion for the Brahmin, and wept loudly.\"Goat,\" said the young Brahmins, \"Why did you loudly laugh and weep?\"\"Ask me your question before your master so that I can asnwer for all of you\", said the goat.So the students brought the goat to their master and told him what transpired. The master asked the goat why it laughed and wept.The animal told the Brahmin: \"In the past, Brahmin, like you, I was a Brahmin versed in themystic texts of the Vedas. In order to host a Feast for the Dead, I killed a goat for my offering.Because of that killing act, I have had my head cut off 499 times. This is my five hundredth and last birth. I laughed aloud because I realized that this very day I will finally be freed from my misery. Then, when I remembered how I was doomed to lose my head 500 times for killing a goat, but you would be doomed to lose your head 500 times. That was why I wept out of great compassion for your impending retribution of great suffering.\"\"Have no fear, goat,\" said the Brahmin, \"I will not kill you.\"The goat replied: \"Whether you kill me or not, I cannot escape death today.\"\"Fear not, goat! I will protect you.\"\"Brahmin, your protection is weak while the force of the retribution of my evil-doing is strong.\"The Brahmin freed the goat and told his disciples, \"Let us allow no one to kill this goat.\"They thus followed the animal closely about. After the goat was set free, it browsed on theleaves of a bush growing near the top of a rock. And that very instant a thunderbolt struck the rock, splintering off a piece which hit the goat on the outstretched neck and tore off its head.​If people knew that the penalty would be for killing living beings is birth into sorrow for a great number of lives, they would refrain from taking life. The force of retribution cannot be easily countervailed."},{"title":"Friend or Foe?","content":"​In a previous lifetime, Ananda was once a newly appointed king who had so many people in his court asking favors of him, that he came and asked a wise cultivator, who was a previous incarnation of the Buddha, “How can I recognize whether someone is a friend or a foe?”        The Buddha then gave him the following list of sixteen deeds that reveal when someone is your foe:When they see you, they neither smile,Nor do they welcome you or look towards you.Generally, they prefer to say no to you.They honor your enemies,And do not care for your friends.They stop those who praise you from doing so,And they praise and encourage those who slander you, especially those who slander you behind your back.They do not tell you their secrets,But they betray your secrets, telling them to others.They never speak well of you,And they never praise your wisdom.They do not rejoice at your welfare,But only rejoice when people speak ill of you.If they receive some delicacies, they will not think of sharing them with you.They never pity you,And they do not publicly state that they are friends with you.“If you see or hear someone perform any of these sixteen deeds,” the Buddha told the king, “then he or she is your foe, and not your friend.” The Buddha then continued by giving the king a corresponding list of deeds that indicate someone is your friend:When they see you, they smile.They think of you when you are absent, and they delight in seeing you when you return, welcoming you with their voice.They often say yes to you.They never honor your enemies,And love to serve your friends.They stop those who slander you from doing so,And they commend those who praise you.They tell you their secrets,And they will never betray your secrets.They always speak well of everything you do,And they love to praise your wisdom.When they hear of your good fortune, they are happy,And they suffer when others speak ill of you.Should they receive some delicacy, they immediately think to share it with you.They pity you,And if you are hurt, they would cry for you, saying, “Oh, my poor friend.”To this list, I might add that a friend will not speak ill of you to others behind your back, and will only point out your flaws to you privately, in person.Although it can be helpful to know who our friends are and who our enemies are, it is important to remember that, from the Buddhist’s perspective, we should not grasp at either friends or foes.Someone wonders what if there are people who sometimes do the deeds of a friend, and sometimes those of a foe? In this case, you may have to trust your gut feeling as to which of their actions are most significant. And ultimately, time will tell who is a true friend and who is a true foe. There is a Vietnamese proverb: “You need to stay up late to know how long the night is.” In other words, when you know someone long enough, you will become very familiar with how they act, which ultimately is the best indicator of their true character.Another person asks: “According to Buddhism, isn’t everyone your friend?” Answer: “No! The demons are not your friends. If you recognize a demon, run!” Very often your closest friends, those who you depend on the most, turn out to be demons that obstruct your cultivation.When you recognize your enemy, do you run? Actually, that’s not what a good cultivator would do. Rather, one should draw near one’s enemies and try to help them become better people. For instance, do you want to know how to help those who are two-faced and deceptive? You have to draw near them and be prepared to let them hurt you.The Buddha himself is a good example of this. Just before the he became enlightened, and after the he defeated the demon king’s armies, the demon king sent his beautiful daughters to tempt the Buddha. But the Buddha quickly turned them away by pointing out that they are no more than “stinking skin bags”. As a result, the demon king became curious how the Buddha could remain unmoved by all his attacks and temptations, and he went to visit the Buddha, wondering whether the Buddha knew something that he did not. The Buddha took this opportunity to speak Dharma for the demon king, who was then able to attain First Stage Arhatship. Here we see how, by patiently enduring his attacks, the Buddha was eventually able to help the demon king. Thus, sometimes you have to let people hurt you before you can teach them. There is a price to pay for helping others."},{"title":"The Pure Life","content":"Once upon a time in India, in a prior life, the Buddha was born into the royal chaplain’s household on the same day as the king’s son. When the king asked his ministers if any child had been born on the same day as his son, they said, “Yes, Sire, a son of your family priest.”       So the king decreed that both of them be given into the charge of royal nurses together. And they both wore the same clothes and had exactly the same things to eat and drink.​When they became of age, they went together to the most reputed teacher to learn all the sciences before they returned home.The king made his son viceroy and bestowed great honor upon him. From that time, the Buddha ate, drank, and lived with the prince-viceroy. There was a great friendship between them.At the death of his father, the young prince ascended the throne and enjoyed great prosperity. The Buddha thought: “My friend now rules the kingdom. When he sees a fitting opportunity, he will certainly give me the office of his family priest. I have enough of a householder’s life. I will become an ascetic and devote myself to a life of purity.”So he asked his parents’ permission, gave up his worldly fortune and, alone, he entered the Himalaya country. There on a charming spot he built himself a thatch hut, and adopting the religious life of an ascetic, he meditated, and lived happily in the mystic life.At this time, the king remembered him and said, “What has become of my friend? He is nowhere to be seen.” His officials told him he had become an ascetic, and was living, they heard, in some delightful grove. The king asked the place of his abode, and said to a great official, “Go and bring my friend back with you. I will make him my chaplain.”The official departed and eventually reached a frontier village. He rested and went with some local foresters to the place where the Buddha dwelt and found him sitting like a golden statue at the door of his hut. After saluting him with the usual compliments, he sat at a respectful distance and thus addressed him: “Reverend Sir, the king desires your return, being anxious to name you the royal chaplain.” The Buddha replied, “If I were to receive not merely the post of chaplain but all of India and the glory of a Wheel Turning King, I would refuse to go. The wise do not again take up the sins they have once abandoned any more than they would swallow the phlegm they have once raised.” The great official returned and thus informed the king of his friend’s refusal of power and influence.*******Modern day people seem to believe that left home people are parasites to society. Little do they know! It’s certainly a very different life style that is far removed from the lust of wealth and fame. They prefer to lead the simple life of a beggar rather than live as a king who cannot resist lust; who rules as a tyrant and oppresses the poor and less fortunate. There is a lot to be said about a life of purity and humility that is devoid of destructive egotistical behavior."},{"title":"The Fallacy of Facts","content":"Long ago in India, a king had four sons. One day they sent for the charioteer and said to him, “We want to see a Judas tree. Show us one!” \"Very well!” The charioteer replied.But he took his time to show them. He took the eldest prince to the forest in the chariot, and showed him the tree at the time when the buds were just sprouting from the stem.       To the second, he showed it when the leaves were green. The third prince was shown the tree when it was blossoming. And to the fourth prince, the servant showed the tree when it was bearing fruit.​Afterwards the four brothers happened to be sitting together and someone asked, “What sort of a tree is the Judas tree?”The first brother answered, “Like a burnt stump!”And the second cried, “Like a banyan tree!”And the third, “Like a piece of meat!”And the fourth said, “Like the acacia!”Naturally, the princes criticized each other insisting that they alone were right. Finally, they all went to see their father: “Your Highness,” they asked, “what sort of a tree is the Judas tree?”“What do you have to say to that?” The King asked.They each told him their individual answers.Said the king: “All four of you did see the tree. Only when the charioteer showed you the tree, you did not ask him, ‘What is the tree like at such a time, or at such another time?’ You made no distinctions, and that is the reason of your mistake.”The moral of the story is: Smart people seek facts, wise people seek wisdom.Furthermore, ordinary people tend to believe in their facts and refuse to accept the others’. They fail to understand that it’s not about being right but it’s about learning to be right together i.e. learning to accept each other’s knowledge and wisdom.We can be so much better off by learning not to be so sure of ourselves and instead, seek out wise people who have a longer vision and deeper understanding."},{"title":"Speak Only Kind Words","content":"Once, the Buddha was born as a bull. When he was still a tiny calf, he was given by his owners to a Brahmin as an offering. The Brahmin treated it like his own child, feeding the young creature on rice-gruel and rice.       When the young bull grew up, he thought thus to himself, “I have been brought up by this Brahmin who suffers great hardship. All of the bulls in India cannot draw what I can. What if I were to repay the Brahmin by making proof of my strength?”Accordingly, one day he said to the Brahmin: “Go, Brahmin, to some rich merchant in town, and wager him a thousand gold pieces that your bull can draw a hundred loaded carts.”The Brahmin went to a merchant and got into a discussion with him on the comparative value of oxen. The Brahmin claimed, “There are no oxen in town which can compare with mine for real strength. I have a bull which can pull a hundred loaded carts.” “Where is such a bull to be found?” laughed the merchant. “I’ve got him at home,” said the Brahmin. “Let’s make it a wager,” the merchant proposed. Certainly,” said the Brahmin, and he staked a thousand pieces.Then they loaded one hundred carts with sand, gravel, and stones, and leashed the hundred carts together, one behind the other. Then, the Brahmin bathed his bull, gave him a measure of perfumed rice to eat, hung a garland round his neck, and harnessed him to the leading cart. The Brahmin took his seat, and with a most triumphant air shouted, “Now then, you rascal! Pull them along, you rascal!”“I’m not the rascal he calls me,” thought the bull. So he planted his four feet and did not budge even an inch.After the Brahmin paid the money to the merchant, he went home and he lied down dejectedly on his bed. The bull walked in and inquired if the Brahmin was taking a nap. “How could I take a nap, when I have just lost a thousand pieces?”“Brahmin, all the time I have lived in your house, have I ever broken a pot, or made a mess?”“Never, my child!”“Then, why did you call me a rascal? It’s you who are to blame. Go and bet him two thousand this time. Only remember not to miscall me rascal again.”The Brahmin went to the merchant, and laid a wager of two thousand. Just as before, they leashed the hundred carts to one another and harnessed the bull to the lead cart.So now seated on the lead cart, the Brahmin stroked the bull on the back, and called on him, “Now then, my fine fellow! Pull them along, my fine fellow!”With a single pull the bull tugged along the whole string of the one hundred carts. The merchant paid up the two thousand pieces to the Brahmin. Other people too gave large sums to the bull, and all the money went to the Brahmin. Thus did he gain greatly, thanks to the bull.The moral of the story is:Speak only words of kindness, never harsh words.Being courteous and fair towards allCan help move heavy loads,And bring you wealth as your reward."},{"title":"Bowing Dharma","content":"​Bowing is very beneficial. Even for those who are not Buddhists, you should bow because bowing is one of the best exercises you can do. Bowing is one of the Yoga techniques. Qi Gong and Tai Ji have bowing techniques too. It’s also one of the advanced martial arts techniques.       Some teachers of Qi Gong, Tai Ji or Yoga who teach bowing may have the tendency to be too fast or too slow. There are some people who have been teaching bowing and Qi Gong at the same time. It becomes a physical exercise. But it’s supposed to be a spiritual exercise. What happens is that you bow a lot: you bow until you break a sweat. This is not too bad: you’re so energized for the entire day. If you practice Tai Ji, they may have the tendency to teach you to bow slowly. There is nothing wrong with that either. What is the normal speed? When it feels natural. I advocate being natural. Someday, you are in a rush, therefore you bow a little bit faster because it’s more natural. Some other days, you are more relaxed, then you bow slower. Either way is acceptable. Just follow your mind, you have to learn to listen to yourself.The bowing mechanics that we use at our temple is that you touch the ground at five spots: the forehead, the hands and the knees.You start first by paying attention to your body. You want to go down, you’re aware of the fluid nature of your movement. Normally, your mind is constantly racing outside yourself after external sounds, images, scents, etc. When you start bowing, you go back inside yourself. You are no longer outside. How? By concentrating on your body motion. At first, it’s kind of stiff. Your motion is jerky. Perhaps, there is a strain in your shoulders, back, or your legs. But eventually if you bow long enough it becomes smooth and natural. Just don’t think about it, don’t worry about it. Keep at it and it naturally happens. You should bow effortlessly. Your motion should to be fluid: it’s not strained, there is no discontinuity whatsoever.After you succeed in bowing smoothly then it is time to learn to empty your mind: stop thinking. That is the bowing dharma. The objective of bowing is stop thinking: to not think. At this point, as you bow down you empty your mind, when you get up you also empty your mind. When you’re down, you are supposed to contemplate. Your mind becomes focused. You have one thought, you try to become single-minded. You contemplate that you are bowing to this Buddha: you contemplate this Buddha being present in the universe, everywhere in the dharma realm, accepting your bow (he steps into your opened palms). If you’re sincere then you can feel that it is being accepted. When it is accepted then you get up. If you can’t feel that, stay there for a few seconds, you anchor your mind to the Buddha. That’s the contemplation. You don’t think about anything else but the Buddha you’re bowing to. That is Chan.When you get up, you truly want to empty yourself and have no thoughts whatsoever. You’re done, there’s nothing left to do except get up. If your mind is not empty yet, then you concentrate on the Buddha.You should follow along with the great assembly: learn to blend in.Closing your eyes will result in having fewer distractions, because you can see things from the corners of your eyes, so closing your eyes can be beneficial.This is a wonderful dharma, because it is a form of bowing meditation, a very high form of bowing practice. Do not think that meditation is only sitting, I am teaching you meditation through bowing as well.I taught a lay person to bow to the Buddhas. She was interested in bowing as a form of repentance. Because of her great sincerity and vigor, she started from being rather scattered to reaching third dhyana within six months.Others teach bowing as a physical exercise. We use bowing to train the mind."},{"title":"The Highest Knowledge","content":"In ancient China, there used to be a very wise prime minister. Originally, he passed the Imperial Examination ranking at the top and was eventually promoted to prime minister. He helped the king rule the country effectively and was fond of getting inspiration from the ancients’ words of wisdom. Naturally, he took a keen interest to Mahayana and became quite well read on Buddhism.      After reading up on Mahayana, he decided to talk to an expert. So, he inquired and was told that the wisest one was someone known as the “Cloth Bag Monk 布袋和尚”. The prime minister sent his subordinates out to request that traveling beggar to come to the royal court for an audience with him. After several failed attempts for one reason or another, the prime minister decided to corner that beggar monk in a street corner himself.​The prime minister said: “Venerable Monk, what is the essence of the Buddha’s teachings?”The Cloth Bag Monk dropped the cloth bag he was carrying. The prime minister was thoughtful for a brief moment then he said: “I see. Surely there must be some higher form of knowledge.”The Cloth Bag Monk picked up the cloth bag and walked away.The prime minister looked stunned for a moment. He finally understood. From then on, he developed a profound respect for Mahayana. He commissioned many temples to be built around the country, sponsored many people to leave the home life to study the teachings and personally came to the temples to make offerings.******What did the prime minister understand when the monk dropped his cloth bag? The cloth bag carried all his worldly possessions. The message was “to drop it”. We should drop our attachments, especially things that we hold to be very dear. Buddhism teaches us to “see it through and put it down 看破, 放下”. That is what wise people are able to do.The prime minister was particularly wise that was why he understood. Then he realized that it was only an end to a goal. That was why he asked for a higher meaning for the teaching. So what did he finally understand when the monk disappeared in the horizon? Keep dropping everything until there is nothing left. Then you will reach True Emptiness, the highest Mahayana teaching."},{"title":"Tell Me","content":"The French have a saying: “Dis moi qui est ton ami, je te dirai qui tu es” which can be translated as “Tell me who your friends are and I’ll tell you who you are”.There was a cultivator in the Himalayas who came to the city during the rainy season for salt and vinegar.       Because of his awesome comportment, the city residents were most impressed and made a lot of offerings to him.

My life has changed, I love to spend time to study Buddhism now...”~ Jade from HonoluluOur Pure Land Group is enthusiastically preparing for the GuanYin Dharma Assembly coming up on October 22, 2011 in San Jose. May I share with you some great news?In the previous Dharma Assembly a few months ago, QDH offered to take care of lunch for the temple (over 150 people came to that Dharma Assembly) as an offering to you and the venerated sangha in order to dedicate the merit and virtue to her grandchild. He was in the ninth grade and neglected his studies because he chose to use drugs with his friends. Her entire family was very distraught because of this. After that lunch, she brought him to see the master and requested the use of the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma to rescue him. The master talked to him briefly and rubbed the crown of his head.Miraculously, one month later, he promised his parents that he would no longer hang out with his bad friends. Last week, his report card showed two A’s, one B and one C. His parents were so happy that they were in tears, not to mention his grand-parents. Therefore this upcoming Dharma Assembly, she asked to offer up the lunch again in order to transfer the merit and virtue to her grand-child.“I thought that you’d like to hear these great news so as your group not to be daunted by the long drive from Los Angeles to San Jose for the Dharma Assembly.”~ NN, San JoseWe are thankful for the supportEach time we organize a Dharma Assembly away from our temple, a lot of our people would tag along.

This young man had squandered an inheritance of forty thousand pieces of gold. Then he visited his uncle, who gave him a thousand pieces, and bade him trade with it.      The man squandered this, and then came again; and once more was given five hundred.​Having squandered this like the rest, next time his uncle gave him two coarse garments. When he had worn these out, he again appealed for assistance. His uncle had him taken by the neck and turned out of doors. The fellow was helpless, and fell down by a side-wall and died. People dragged him outside the city walls and threw his body into a ditch.Anāthapiṇḍika went and told the Buddha what had happened to his nephew. The World Honored One said: “How could you expect to satisfy the man whom I long ago failed to satisfy, even when I gave him the Wishing Cup?”Once upon a time, the Buddha was born as a rich merchant’s son. After his father’s death, he took his place. In his house was buried a treasure of four hundred million pieces of gold. He had an only son. The Buddha gave alms and did good until he died. He then was born as Shakra, king of the gods.His son proceeded to make a pavilion across the road, and sat down with many friends round him, to drink. He paid a thousand pieces to runners and tumblers, singers and dancers, and passed his time in drinking, gluttony, and debauchery. He wandered about, seeking song, music, and dancing, devoted to his parasite companions, sunk in sloth. So in no time, he squandered all his inheritance of four hundred millions, all his property, goods, and furniture. He got so poor and miserable that he had to go about clad in rags.Shakra, as he meditated, became aware how poor his son was. Overcome with love for his son, he gave him a Wishing Cup, with these words: “Son, take care not to break this cup. As long as you keep it, your wealth will never come to an end. So take good care of it!” and then he returned to heaven.After that, the man did nothing but drink out of it. One day, he was drunk, and threw the cup into the air, catching it as it fell. But he missed it. Down it fell upon the earth, and smashed! Then he got poor again, and went about in rags, begging until at last he lay down by a wall, and died.The Buddha then explained that the foolish son was later born as Anāthapiṇḍika’s nephew.Sometimes, leaving assets as inheritance is not helpful to the unwise. It is better to impart wisdom and help them plant blessings, especially the non-outflow kinds of blessings with Mahayana."},{"title":"Not as great as it seems","content":"The older buffalo told its brother: “See?Do not envy that pig’s food.What it ate was not for its own good.Be content with your chaff.It means long life on your behalf. ”   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t       One day, the younger buffalo told its older brother: “You know our owner also has a pig.

What school of morals, sect or learning would make wise friends?”The father replied: “Anyone who can gain your confidence and love. She can trust your words and be patient toward you; and in thought, word and deed will never offend you. Then you should cling to her as friend.

He had a young brother. After their father died, they did some business that took them to a village, where they were paid a thousand pieces of money.      On their way back, as they waited on a river-bank for the boat, they ate lunch. The older brother threw his lunch remains into the Ganges for the fishes, dedicating the merit to the river-spirit. The spirit was with gratitude for the kindness. The older brother then took a nap on the river bank.The young brother was greedy by nature. He wanted to steal the money and keep it for himself. So he packed a parcel of gravel to look like the parcel of money, and put them both away.When they both boarded the boat and arrived to mid-river, the younger stumbled against the side of the boat, and dropt overboard the parcel of gravel.“Brother, the money’s overboard!” he cried. “What’s to be done?”“What can we do? What’s gone is gone. Never mind about it,” replied the other.But the river-spirit intervened. She made a big-mouthed fish swallow the parcel.When the thief got home, he quickly went his room and undid the remaining parcel. There was nothing but gravel to be seen! So he did drop the real coins into the river.Meanwhile some fishermen just then cast their nets. By power of the river-spirit, this fish fell into the net. The fishermen took it to the market. People asked for the price.“A thousand pieces and seven coins” said the fishermen.Everybody made fun of them. “We have seen a fish offered for a thousand pieces!” they laughed.The fishermen brought their fish to the big brother’s door, and asked him to buy it.“What’s the price?” he asked.“You may have it for seven coins,” they said.“What did you ask other people for it?”“From other people we asked a thousand pieces and seven coins; but you may have it for seven coins,” they said.He paid for it, and sent it to his wife. She cut it open, and there was the parcel of money! He wondered how it was that he had recovered his money. At the moment the river-spirit invisibly appeared in the air, and declared: “I am the Spirit of the Ganges. You gave the remains of your meal to the fishes, and let me have the merit. Therefore I have taken care of your property.”Then the spirit told about the mean trick which the younger brother had played. Then she added, “There is no prosperity for the cheat. But I have brought you your own, and I warn you not to lose it. Don’t give it to your young thief of a brother, but keep it all yourself.”But the big brother said, “That is impossible,” and all the same sent the brother his share of five hundred coins.Would you do the same?Let’s think about it. If this young man would scheme to steal from his older brother such a small sum, one can’t help but wonder what else he’s up to with the rest of the family fortune.Furthermore, for most people the discovery of your own sibling’s treachery and betrayal would be devastating and would leave a very bitter taste in your mouth.And yet, the big brother still honored his younger brother.Once in blue moon, this kind of generosity might make the evil feel guilty and change their ways. Regardless, if you can find it your heart to forgive and forget, you’ll be happier and more at ease."},{"title":"Sanghan Goal","content":"[In response to one of the questions in Vietnamese] Thank you for your kind words. I definitely feel unworthy of such praises.I will try to give you some brief answers to some of your questions where I feel I can offer my humble opinion.​First of all, I am very glad to hear of left home people who have aspirations to cultivate the BuddhaDharma.      Teachers can only teach their ignorance. Therefore, left home people’s objectives should include breaking through our ignorance, to unfold our wisdom before we teach. Teachers must help their pupils open their wisdom and obtain liberation. Therefore, your aspiration is quite commendable: left home people should speak Dharma and explain sutras.I explain sutras because I want to repay the kindness of my teachers and the patriarchs. I was most fortunate in having received the teachings of many good knowing advisers and therefore know of only one way to pay back their kindness: practice according to the teachings and explain the teachings so as to make sure the future generations can also benefit from the teachings. I really have no Dharma of my own. I just elaborate the sages’ doctrines and methods.In my humble opinion, you lack concrete goals in your life. Clearly, to leave the home life is a most commendable undertaking but the majority of the left home people tend to lose track of one of the goals of becoming a monk or nun.The first small goal of a sanghan is to end birth and death. Today, I’ll only address this small matter and will elaborate on the bigger goals on another occasion.To end birth and death means to attain Fourth Stage Arhatship.Then how does your planning to go to Thailand, India etc… help toward your achieving this goal?Just like many sanghans of your generation, you have ideals but lack the proper guidance.Allow me to speak frankly without beating around the bush in the interest of time.You seem to be not greedy for fame and profit. You don’t seem to aspire to have a big temple for yourself. Since you are already ahead of the game, you should resolve to attain liberation this lifetime in order to repay the kindness of your teacher.Personally, I do not believe that obtaining a degree (like many present days left home people aspire to do) will bring on liberation. Why not?  If you want to end birth and death, you must seek out someone who has done so to learn from him or her. I have yet to meet a university professor who has put an end to birth and death. They can teach you the knowledge from books but cannot teach you methods to help unfold your transcendental wisdom. That is why I advocate not going for doctorate degrees but rather invest our time and efforts in unfolding our Prajna Wisdom.That is why I advocate seeking the guidance of a clear-eye, good knowing adviser. The ancients have a saying: “the lamp light can eradicate one thousand years of darkness of the room”. If you cultivate without the proper guidance then it’s no different from searching for your way in the dark. Conversely, having a good knowing adviser is like obtaining a light to illuminate the way.Two years ago, a Vietnamese Bhikshuni came to the United States for a visit. She came to our temple to take a look because she heard that we practice Great Master Xuan Hua’s dharma. She also found out that we also practice Chan and Pure Land in parallel. She was enamored with Vipassana (a famous Hinayana meditation method). She confessed to me that she was never impressed with Pure Land. In the past, she often asked the monks who practiced reciting the Buddha’s name: “(If reciting the Buddha’s name is that great), show me your recitation gongfu”. When she met me, she suddenly forgot to ask me to recite the Buddha’s name for her to see. She later admitted that she used to be tongue-tied whenever she saw me.Why is it that we sanghans who are challenged by others, often fail to inspire respect from the Buddhist disciples?  It’s because our gongfu (samadhi) is too low. Her gongfu was pretty good because she had been practicing Vipassana for quite a while. Her teacher’s gongfu is quite good too and that was why her method was not bad at all. Originally she planned to visit us for only a few days. A few days turned into a few months because she discovered that her meditation methodology had significant drawbacks. She decided then to remain at the temple to cultivate because she found out that reciting the Buddha’s name was far better than Vipassana. Two years later, her wisdom began to open up: she decided to take refuge and wished to learn the secrets of Mahayana cultivation. She switched from seeking the small (obtain liberation) to devoting her life to the big task: unfold her Prajna Wisdom.I hope that you too will encounter a good knowing adviser who is willing to guide you. They are quite demanding. Should you get interviewed by any of them, please make sure not to say that your goal is “no ranking status at the temple, no obligation, and no attachment to anything in this world whatsoever; only one thing left to do is to provide sutra lectures.”Finally, since you do not understand meditation yet, why would you want to teach meditation?  Those who understand Mahayana meditation (Chan) would not teach Vipassana at all. If you meet with people who like to meditate, you should impress on them the importance to seek out a competent meditation teacher. Westerners could use Great Master Xuan Hua’s English books as reference. You are right, most other books are not helpful because the authors have not accomplished the Dharma yet and decided to teach prematurely.Moreover, those who have the aptitude should be taught Chan instead of Pure Land.Allow me to make one last suggestion: resolve to practice Mahayana. Each day, you should do something to create Mahayana blessings. You could bow 300 times to Great Master Xuan Hua. Afterwards, kneel and pray for his guidance to help you locate a good knowing adviser. The more sincere you are the sooner you will obtain a response. Many have obtained his help in that fashion.I wish you the best of luck in your quest."},{"title":"An invitation to this month’s Chan Qi","content":"​We’d like to cordially invite you to come and participate in a Chan Qi that will be held at the end of this month during the Memorial Day weekend (5/28/11-6/4/11).  ​More details can be found on our English and Vietnamese web sites:www.chanpureland.com and www.TinhDoDaiThua.org.       We’ve just decided to organize this Chan Qi in addition to our customary annual Chan Qi at the end of the year because the last Chan Qi’s participants have had very good responses, more so than the year before.  We advocate cultivating Chan and Pure Land in parallel and therefore take Chan training very seriously because it can help quickly increase samadhi.​Although the daily meditation schedule is from 3am until midnight, people can come and participate in as many sessions as possible.  We can provide instructions and assistance to the novice practitioners or the advanced ones.  Everyone is free to use the opportunity to cultivate their own meditation technique and obtain answers to obstructions to their practice.  We will also provide instructions on a special meditation technique called GuanYin meditation (contemplating the sound).Since we’ve started transmitting the Guan Yin Dharma door of GuanYin Bodhisattva eight months ago, many of our students have demonstrated good progress: several have reached the first major milestone.  One student reported entering samadhi for an hour at home.  Another reported that while she attended our weekend Sunday short practice session the beginning last month, she saw GuanYin Bodhisattva dressed in white appear in the Buddha Hall at the end of the silent sit  when she opened her eyes.If you are curious and wish to learn this very effective meditation technique, please reserve a spot as soon as possible.  Participation is free of charge as per our tradition of not charging for Dharma events.  It is a small way, our attempt to payback the kindness of our teachers and most generous support from the community.  Since our temple is rather modest in size, we can only provide accommodations to 50 participants.Please do join us.Sincerely,Emituofo,​Master YongHua."},{"title":"The Fallacy of Facts","content":"Long ago in India, a king had four sons. One day they sent for the charioteer and said to him, “We want to see a Judas tree. Show us one!”      “Very well!” The charioteer replied.​But he took his time to show them. He took the eldest prince to the forest in the chariot, and showed him the tree at the time when the buds were just sprouting from the stem. To the second, he showed it when the leaves were green. The third prince was shown the tree when it was blossoming. And to the fourth prince, the servant showed the tree when it was bearing fruit.Afterwards the four brothers happened to be sitting together and someone asked, “What sort of a tree is the Judas tree?”The first brother answered, “Like a burnt stump!”And the second cried, “Like a banyan tree!”And the third, “Like a piece of meat!”And the fourth said, “Like the acacia!”Naturally, the princes criticized each other insisting that they alone were right. Finally, they all went to see their father: “Your Highness,” they asked, “what sort of a tree is the Judas tree?”“What do you have to say to that?” The King asked.They each told him their individual answers.Said the king: “All four of you did see the tree. Only when the charioteer showed you the tree, you did not ask him, ‘What is the tree like at such a time, or at such another time?’ You made no distinctions, and that is the reason of your mistake.”The moral of the story is: Smart people seek facts, wise people seek wisdom.Furthermore, ordinary people tend to believe in their facts and refuse to accept the others’. They fail to understand that it’s not about being right but it’s about learning to be right together i.e. learning to accept each other’s knowledge and wisdom.We can be so much better off by learning not to be so sure of ourselves and instead, seek out wise people who have a longer vision and deeper understanding."},{"title":"On Loyalty","content":"Once upon a time, the Buddha was born as a crow. He grew up, and became king of eighty thousand crows. He had a chief mate, crowned as crow queen and also had a chief captain crow. One day he and his mate in search of food passed over the king’s kitchen.       The king’s cook had been preparing a host of dishes, of all sorts of fish, and he had uncovered the dishes for a moment, to cool them. Queen Crow smelt the odor of the food and craved for a taste. But that day she said nothing.​However the next day, when king crow proposed that they should go a feeding, she said, “Go by yourself: there’s something I really want!”“What is it?” asked he.“I want some of the king’s food to eat; and if I can’t get it, I am going to die.”The crow sat down to think. His chief captain approached and asked if anything had displeased him. King crow told him what it was. “Oh, that’ll be all right,” said the captain; and reassured them both: “you stay where you are today, and I’ll fetch the meal.”So he gathered the crows together, and told them the matter. “Now come, and let’s get it!” said he; and off they all flew together to the castle. He posted them in companies here and there, near the kitchen to watch; and he, with eight assistants, sat on the kitchen roof. While waiting for the king’s food to be served, he gave his directions to these: “When the food is taken up, I’ll make the man drop the dishes. Once that is done there’s an end of me. So four of you must fill your mouths with the rice, and four with the fish, and feed our royal pair with them; and if they ask where I am, say I’m coming.”Well, the cook got his various dishes all ready and brought them to the king’s rooms. As he passed through the court, the crow captain with a signal to his followers flew and settled upon the carrier’s chest, struck him with extended claws, with his beak, sharp as a spear-point, pecked the end of the man’s nose.The king was walking up and down upon an upper floor, when looking out of a large window he saw what the crow was doing. He hailed the carrier: “Catch the crow!” The man dropped the dishes and caught the crow tight.“Come here!” cried the king.Then the crows ate all they wanted, and picked up the rest as they had been told, and carried it off. Next all the others flocked up, and ate what remained. The eight assistant crows gave it to their king and queen to eat. The craving of queen crow was appeased.The servant who was carrying the dinner brought the crow to the king.“O Crow!” said he, “you have shown no respect for me! You have broken my servant’s nose! You have smashed my dishes! You have recklessly thrown away your life! What made you do such things?”The crow answered: “O great king! Our king lives nearby, and I am captain of his forces. His wife had a great longing, and wanted a taste of your food. Our king told me what she craved. At once I devoted my life. Now I have sent her the food; my desire is accomplished. This is the reason why I acted as I did.”When the king heard this, he said: “We do great honor to men, and yet cannot make friends of them. Even though we make presents of such things as a whole village, we can find no one willing to give his life for us. But this creature, crow as he is, sacrifices life for his king. He is very noble, sweet-speaking, and good.” He was so pleased with the crow’s good qualities that he bestowed honors upon him and released him.​The queen crow was later to become the Buddha’s wife and the chief crow captain: Shariputra. The king was Ananda."},{"title":"Too Fond of Home","content":"There was a village close by a great river and great lake. When water was abundant, river and lake were one. When water was scarce, they were apart. Instinctively, the fish and tortoises seemed to know when the season would be rainy or when there would be a drought.​Once they knew that a drought was forth coming, when the river and lake were one they swam out from the lake to the river. However, one tortoise refused to follow along, proclaiming: “here I was born and grown up; here’s my ancestral home; leave it I shall not!”       Thus in the hot season, the drought came and all the lake water dried up. Our loner tortoise dug a hole and buried itself in the clay.That place also happened to be the place where the villagers usually come for clay. Thus one day, one man came around and dug for clay. With a big spade, he dug down and cracked the tortoise’s shell because he thought that it was a large clump of clay.So the tortoise lied there dying and lamenting: “here I was born and lived; I took refuge in clay refusing to go where there was life; take heed and do not stay at home for death to master thee.”We all should take heed.Let’s not say to ourselves: “I have a home (physical dwelling); I have sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch (my body is my home); I have a spouse, a son and daughter, men and maids at my service (my family is my home); I have money and gold (my home is my treasure)”.Let’s not cling to externals that bind us with craving and desires and inexorably make us revolve in the wheel of reincarnation and existences that are fraught with afflictions and difficulties.Instead, let’s resolve to cultivate and plant the causes for rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land this very lifetime and attain liberation and bliss in one lifetime.​That is the conduct and motivation of wise people."},{"title":"Violating Human Rights","content":"This anecdote was brought up during last week’s Earth Store sutra lecture. Unfortunately, the whole lecture was not recorded because he experienced some technical difficulties. It’s about a story of the life of the Buddha which generated a lot of controversy. We thought the lesson was important enough to reiterate here.      When the Buddha was on the causal ground (planting the causes for Buddhahood), he practiced vigorously for a long time and had made significant attainments.He then was born as crown prince. His father was a very powerful monarch because his army was invincible. In particular, the king had a special weapon: he had a young elephant which could crush any army it faced. Needless to say, the elephant was the king father’s national treasure and therefore pampered accordingly.It would seem that the crown had it made because the elephant was till in its early youth and would probably outlive the young prince should he succeed his father to the throne.Strangely though, the crown prince was only interested in charity work. He could give away anything that was asked of him. His reputation for generosity spread far and wide.There was an evil rival to the father king, a king of another powerful country. The rival monarch had designs and devised a scheme to harm his opponent.He went to the crown prince and asked to see him. At the audience, the evil monarch asked the crown prince for his father’s elephant. After hesitating for a while because the elephant was really not his to give away, the crown prince relented and stole into the elephant’s table and stealthily gave it to the evil king who rapidly led it away.When the king father discovered that his favorite elephant was missing, the crown prince quickly confessed to his father who said: “I don’t mind that you deplete my coffers through your acts of charity. But giving away our elephant national treasure is just unthinkable! You are hereby banished in shame from my kingdom.”The sad prince went home and informed his family. He told his wife and two young sons: “my father only banished me for my offense. You can still remain here since you are innocent.”His devoted wife and loving sons would not hear of it and insisted on accompanying him wherever he went. So, they loaded their meager possessions onto a cart that the crown prince pulled while his wife and two sons pushed from behind and left the kingdom.Along the way, they were ridiculed and mocked at by the general population for the prince’s betrayal. Yet they stuck together.Then they met a slave merchant who took a liking to the two young princes. He shamelessly asked the crown prince for the two sons saying that he could fetch a good price for them.Before the crown prince had the chance to say anything, his wife immediately interjected: “Over my dead body!” The ex-crown prince thus did not dare say anything.He then asked his wife to go fetch some water down the river. While she went down the slope, the ex-crown prince quickly handed his two sons to the slave trader who immediately left with them.When the wife came back and discovered that her two sons were given away, she was totally distraught but stuck with her husband.As they continued on, they met a man who was drawn to the prince’s wife and asked the ex-crown prince for her.At this point, she was the only person left who was totally devoted to him. And yet, he consented to give her away as well.And that was how Shakyamuni Buddha practiced giving in a prior lifetime.When I told this story last week, one Caucasian student was quite upset. As we discussed it for an hour and a half, he was adamant and insisted that the prince was all wrong. He felt that the crown prince must have felt on his head and become insane.First of all, how many crown princes would give away the elephant? That would hurt his own father, put the country in jeopardy and without a doubt ruin his own future.​Furthermore, to give away his children and wife is a clear violation of their human rights!It should be no surprise to you that in many Buddhist circles, there was bitter debates about this story. One camp thought that the crown prince was wrong. The opposing camp in contrast felt that it was a former life of the Buddha, he could have not been wrong. Neither could convince their opponent of their own arguments.I submit to you all that you are all wrong!It’s not about knowledge, reason or logic.That was true giving. When the ex-crown prince finally gave away his lovely and devoted wife, he attained the ultimate giving: when all three components of giving are empty. The giver (the crown prince), the gift (his wife) and receiver (the man who coveted her) are all empty.At that point, the ex-crown prince became enlightened.​The story is not meant for intellectual discussion. It’s meant to teach us about doing. If we can do it, we too can become enlightened."},{"title":"Being Good","content":"The topic of gratitude came up in one of our sutra class discussions. As an immigrant, I too greatly benefitted from the kindness of this great country. The generosity ranges from free ESL classes to subsidized job training, rental allowances to transportation subsidies, etc …      It’s wonderful because it allows the newcomers the chance to preserve their dignity and time to be able to stand on their feet and fully participate in realizing their own American dream.Over time, this system has worked very well. So well that many first generation immigrants became very successful financially. A few would remember the country’s past support and kindness and would make it a point to give back. The overwhelming majority conveniently forget the initial welfare support as if it’s their god-given right.My Caucasian students commented that it does not matter because that’s how the system works. The people of this country still give and expect nothing in return.I beg to differ. It may not matter to the giver but it definitely should matter to the beneficiaries. They should be grateful for the many gifts and so much kindness. Gratitude is what differentiates us from the animal realm. You don’t repay kindness by pilfering the system through tax evasions and other similar destructive behaviors.Furthermore, the person who has no gratitude knows no happiness. Such people are very lonely and have no clue as to why so! Happiness is a human condition reserved for those who qualify as decent human beings.From a spiritual perspective, to accept someone kindness can be considered to get into debt. If we don’t repay the debt quickly, it tends to accrue interests. If we’re not careful, sometimes the interest charges and collection fees can far exceed the original loan!It would be wise to quickly repay if we can.When most people focus on the financial amounts, they tend to overlook the intangibles. For example, in the case of the aid to the immigrants, the debt has two parts: financial and kindness.Kindness debts must be repaid with kindness. That means giving back to society, protecting it and improving it, not destroying it for the sake of personal gains.​While it is important to try to quickly repay our benefactors. It would be counterproductive and narrow minded to be overly obsessive about repaying the specific individuals to settle the debts.Can’t we simply be good? I mean can we do good for everyone? That would seem to be the original purport of the system.Let’s be good. Let’s help others and expect nothing in return."},{"title":"Four kinds of people","content":"During the past six years of teaching Chan and Pure Land, I’ve noticed that there are four kinds of people that come to us:Competent and un-virtuousCompetent and virtuousIncompetent and un-virtuousIncompetent and virtuous.      1. Competent and un-virtuous: this is the majority of the people. They are smart and are quite successful at getting what they want while getting away with cutting corners and compromising their morals if need be.They consider themselves superior and sophisticated people of the world. They pride themselves on being able to recognize value and what is beneficial to them. Life for them is the perpetual pursuit of fame and/or profits. As usual, they grab what they can and leave when better opportunities present themselves.The only trouble is that they fail to recognize the true value of cultivation. As the Chinese put it: “they came to the treasure trove and left empty-handed”. The most pitiful fact is that: they are not happy because of their overwhelming fear of failure.Had they persevered even though they failed the tests, they become2. Competent and virtuous: these individuals are quite remarkable. They patiently endured the tests that were sprung on them and managed to hang on without quitting.For example, we wish to support those left home people who sincerely wish to learn how to cultivate. That’s why we try to create an environment for cultivators: they need to only concentrate on cultivation without worries about rent, pocket money and basic necessities. The temple, even though quite small, does not engage in commercial activities such as selling food or begging for financial support (such as fund raising activities). We live modestly and learn to get by with whatever support we deserve for our cultivation. For newly arrived left home people, they need to go through at least two months of trial period before they are formally accepted into our order. Believe me, that’s two long months for the current residents as well!As to the lay people, we are quite proud and fond of them. They learn to be better fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and neighbors and members of the community. They become more filial, pleasant to be around and dependable. These are superior individuals who are the true pillars of our society.3. Incompetent and un-virtuous: this represents the majority of those who only come to the temple hoping to get something out of nothing.Some come to us crying about relatives who are suffering debilitating diseases that they have nowhere else to turn to for help. Some come looking for a miracle that will make their troubles go away so that they can continue creating offenses.When told that they need to make changes and that miracles can happen if they are sincere enough, they can’t bring forth the faith. Or perhaps, it simply won’t work for them because they need to change their ways. Besides, aren’t left home people like us supposed to be the virtuous ones who practice unconditional giving?They are quite right: we do practice unconditional giving to the virtuous ones.They can be spotted a mile away. They may be driving Mercedes but have an insecure look about them, perhaps because deep down they know that people disapprove of them. They are so unhappy because they feel unwelcome everywhere. They can’t be helped.4. Incompetent and virtuous: These people have potential. It takes longer to teach them but they eventually blossom and unfold their wisdom.They are secretly quite critical of others, especially of left-home people whom they hold to quite strict and high moral standards.Once they are convinced that we measure up to their standards, it still takes years for them to bring forth the faith.By the way, most left home people fall into this category. If they have faith and concentrate on cultivation, they can attain sagely fruitions. This is what is so special about the Buddhist left-home training program (Dharma doors).Lay people who manage to hang on, ALL become healthier and wiser. They also do become more competent.Over all, it has been a most fascinating learning experience for me.The obvious question is: which one(s) do I prefer?The answer is … None of the above.Why?​You tell me why you deserve to be helped."},{"title":"D&B Series Part 3: What Happens When We Die?","content":"The Tibetans have a pretty good understanding on how to deal with death. I would like to offer a brief talk on the Mahayana perspective on death.What Is Death? In Buddhism, death occurs when the life force is cut off.​Life force (Chinese: mìng gen 命根; Vietnamese: mệnh căn) has three components:      Warmth (Chinese: nuǎn 暖 ; Vietnamese noãn),Breath (Chinese: xí 息; Vietnamese: túc),Consciousness (Chinese: shì 識; Vietnamese: thức).Consciousness refers to the eighth consciousness (the store consciousness). At birth, it is the first that arrives. At death, it is the last to leave.And then?Life After DeathAt the time of death, in most cases, people normally go into a state of being called the Intermediate Skandha Body.This is a state of consciousness (i.e. no body) which dies every seven days. During this seven-day period, the deceased is led before King Yama who decides where the deceased is to be reincarnated. King Yama is an official in the nether world who is in charge of the life spans of ordinary people and has the authority to decide which kind of body the deceased will inhabit next. During this trial, the deeds of the decedent’s past life are tabulated and used to determine his or her next rebirth. For example, if the net result is negative (i.e. more bad deeds than good deeds), it could be decided that we fall into the three states of woes: the animal realm, hungry ghosts or hells. On the other hand, if it turns out to be positive, we could return to the human realm or be headed for the god realm.The Intermediate Skandha Body only lives for seven days and then dies. This occurs for up to seven weeks. The deceased could be assigned to rebirth anytime during this seven week (49 day) period.Occasionally, people are immediately reincarnated without going through the Intermediate Skandha Body. For example, those who have accrued good karmas (purely created good karmas), may immediately be reborn to the heavens or Pure Lands. Conversely, those who are very evil could fall directly into the hells.No Day at the BeachWhat happens to us during this Intermediate Skandha Body state?The Earth Store sutra clearly describes this state: the deceased perceives only total darkness and silence. In other words, one is totally disoriented. Our sense organs are no longer functional.Also, it feels very cold. For example, one of my students has an uncle who led a financially successful, albeit morally debatable, life. Upon his death, during the first seven days, he was frozen in fear and his legs felt like ice.The Earth Store sutra further states that during the judgment periods (a total of 49 days), one undergoes many sufferings. Why? It is like owing money to many banks. If they find out that we are about to skip town, they send collectors who come knocking on our door day and night to get repaid, wouldn’t you think? Similarly, those creditors and enemies from our past lives may know that we are going for rebirth, and they too would surround and harass us without mercy, while they have a chance.Help for the DeadIt is possible to provide assistance to the deceased during this 49-day period. However, one could also make it worse for the deceased.The Asian culture has the tradition of creating blessings for the deceased to affect his or her rebirth.For example, many Asian cultures have the custom of going to the temples and sponsoring ceremonies to create blessings to help the deceased obtain a good rebirth. This is a most excellent idea.Unfortunately, over time, it degenerated into a superstitious custom of organizing a pompous affair to assuage the survivors’ face. Family members would hire ceremony performers (lay people who recite Buddhist sutras and perform various forms of ceremonies and chanting), burn paper money (to provide assets to the netherworld), burn large paper boats (providing for safe passage to the next life) or organize huge feasts where pigs and fowls are slaughtered and eaten. These affairs are quite impressive to the living but are of little help to the deceased.If you do good deeds (reciting the Buddha’s name, chanting sutras, abstaining from eating meat, etc.) on behalf of the deceased, then these good deeds generate blessings that are taken into consideration every one of the, up to seven, times that King Yama reviews his or her case.On the other hand, if bad karmas are created in the name of the dead (killing animals for feasts, drunkenness etc.), these result in further burdening the decedent’s case in the courts below.I’m taking the time to explain this because many of my Caucasian students who have studied Buddhism from the Japanese, Tibetan or South Asian cultures for many years did not know of this judgment day.Everything we do eventually catches up with us.During this 49-day period, the decedent desperately wants to scream for help but cannot.For example, the Caucasian may have the custom of organizing a wake to celebrate the life of the deceased, that may include a feast that includes the consumption of meat and alcohol to send him or her off. This is a very bad idea because it is like the following analogy. Imagine yourself disoriented, treading muddy water with great difficulty (Intermediate Skandha Body). Then your family and friends come over and attach a hundred-pound weight to you, and they have no way of knowing that it is not helping you!The Right HelpNow that you know, please try to do good deeds on behalf of the deceased during the ensuing 49 days after death. In particular, refrain from creating bad karmas such as killing animals or violating other precepts, because this is tallied up against them!​It’s an excellent idea to sponsor Buddhist ceremonies during this period to assist in the dead’s optimal rebirth. There is no need to waste money on superstitious things such as burning fake paper money, paper donkeys, paper boats, etc., because they are of no use.I do recommend going to Mahayana temples to ask for help. If you’re blessed, you may be able to enlist some great help for the deceased from some competent monks or nuns. It is of utmost importance because this may be the last and most important thing that you can do for your loved one or friend.I personally love to practice Chan but decided to specialize in teaching Mahayana Pure Land Buddhism because I believe that rebirth in the Pure Land is the best possible option for all of us in the Dharma Ending Age. I learned my Pure Land Dharma from my late teacher, Great Master Xuan Hua who is the first American Patriarch of Orthodox Buddhism (the main lineage of Mahayana).​We are small time monks and nuns who hope to help others obtain rebirth in the Pure Lands. Over the years, we have been able to send people off to the Western Bliss Pure Land. Amongst them are a Taoist, a Catholic, an atheist, a non-Buddhist as well as many Buddhists. Funny thing: they were informed that they could go back to the human realm or to the heavens. So far, when given a choice (by King Yama), they all opted for the Western Bliss Pure Land."},{"title":"In remembrance of Great Master Sheng Yi","content":"Last month, our BLI Buddhist Association completed a 49-day Assembly for Great Master Sheng Yi 聖一 who entered Stillness in August 3, 2010. He was recognized as a patriarch for the Gui Yang Chan lineage 潙仰宗 from his teacher, Great Master Xu Yun 虛雲.​I had the privilege of meeting and learning from him almost a decade ago in his Pao Lin 寶林 Chan monastery in Hong Kong. Back then, he could barely walk with the assistance of his monk attendant. Shortly afterwards, he was confined to a wheel chair until his recent death.   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t       Needless to say, he endured tremendous physical pain and sufferings for all these long years.Left home people should all try to emulate the selfless acts of these great monks. They:Attained self liberation, destroying the ignorance darkness in their mind and fulfilled the purport for leaving the home life. In fact, Great Master Sheng Yi was actually a Bodhisattva in the flesh.Spend their career helping others attain liberation. He helped train many enlightened pupils.Never hesitated to take on others’ sufferings. The Great Master chose to remain in our Saha world until the age of 92, in spite of serious illnesses, in order to help those with whom he had conditions.Lay people should resolve to quickly attain Bodhi. If you feel that you cannot attain liberation this lifetime then you should resolve to attain rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land so that you can become a Buddha the very next lifetime. In that way, your encountering with Mahayana and our enlightened teachers’ efforts would have not been in vain."},{"title":"On Greatness","content":"Confucius, the great Chinese sage said: “Great men, 1) when rich, do not indulge in sex; 2) when poor, do not move; 3) when threatened, do not submit.”      The term “great men” should be interpreted to include women as well. Greatness certainly transcends sex, age, faith, race, etc.1) When rich, do not indulge in sex.The rich and powerful seem to be magnets for the opposite sex.When I worked in the corporate world, I was acquainted with a gorgeous marketing manager in her late twenties. She was of Scandinavian descent with blue eyes and blond hair and was nicknamed “Hot Legs”. She was a doctor’s daughter and married to a successful advertising sales manager. She confessed to me that she was attracted to the older executives because of her attraction to powerful men. Needless to say, our executives had a “hard time” with her looks. Rumor had it: she earned many promotions even though her professional performance was subpar.Falling prey to sexual desire, and subsequently basing decisions on personal relationships or favors rather than objective information, would exclude one from greatness.2) When poor, do not move.To move, in this case, is compromising one’s principles to gain an advantage. Greatness is based on staying your course to reach a goal, not changing objectives to accommodate the wind whenever it blows in another direction.The poor and destitute do not have much to lose. Not many would care if they compromise themselves, except that they themselves do care!Ordinary people value material possessions, perhaps because they represent a yardstick for success. In contrast, great people are moved neither by riches nor poverty, choosing to stick to their principles and do the right thing even at great personal costs.Left home people deliberately choose to get by with minimal possessions. I do so because I have no choice. I hope that someday when I become rich (i.e. having many big temples and huge bank accounts), I can still uphold the Buddha’s teachings.3) When threatened, do not submit.To be threatened means that one’s life is in danger. Most of us probably regard life as the most precious thing we have. Yet, great people do not yield to danger or possible harm to their bodies.Greatness is in living up to the principles that seem to transcend time, such as kindness, compassion, aiding the poor and helpless, doing good, not stealing, not abusing power, not betraying others’ trust, loyalty, gratitude to those who helped us, selflessness, etc.In these hard times of severe worldwide recession, which began with the subprime loan crises of 2008, we need great leaders who will step to the plate and liberate us.These great leaders should focus on action that solves problems, not empty rhetoric.​For example, in the aftermath of the 2009 Haiti earthquake, the government of Haiti all but disappeared. In the subsequent two weeks, the wife of Haiti’s president was seen talking to television reporters about how she luckily escaped serious injuries when the presidential palace collapsed. She further insisted that her husband was going from emergency meeting to emergency meeting. Yet, he failed to seize the opportunity to make public appearances to reassure his people, make appeals to the international community for aid and support, and rally his own government officials to serve their people. I have few hopes for the prospects of this country when led by such individuals.Likewise, a great country deserves to be led by great men.I wince every time I hear President Obama (and his aides) referring to himself as a pragmatist.With all due respect, I believe that pragmatism falls short of people’s expectations. A pragmatist solves what is possible. Great men have great vision, and surround themselves with competent people to help achieve their goals.Great men are not afraid to tell their constituents the truth. For example, I’m still waiting for our leaders to dare to tell us the truth about our situation. The US government has made promises to its people that it cannot keep; there is no way to get out of our financial predicament without taking the bitter pill – higher taxes and lower social welfare (cut Medicare and Social Security).I really blame the people for tolerating this hypocrisy. Elect more honest politicians who are not afraid to tell us the truth because we deserve no less.Finally, great leaders should often undertake this exercise: roll up their sleeves and go and meet with the people they represent. They must not act like royalty; they need to feel, or at least witness, the pain that the people feel before they can understand how to provide relief."},{"title":"On Emptying the Self","content":"Why do we advocate emptying the Self?What is the Self?​How can the Self be emptied?      Those who have been exposed to Buddhism may have heard about the Self being empty.First of all, I can assure you that we Buddhists are normal people like yourselves. At least, most of us do feel pain when pinched, get misty eyes when hearing a sob story, and are not that crazy about long cold winters.Then why do we advocate emptying the Self?What About Emptiness?Buddhism is also known as the Dharma Door of Emptiness (Chinese: Kong mén 空門, Vietnamese: không môn).A sophisticated person would explain that things are intrinsically empty because they arise from conditions. When conditions disperse, they return to emptiness. For example, our body is made up of the four great elements of earth (making our flesh and solid parts), wind (e.g. our breathing), fire (body warmth) and water (our bodily fluids). We obtain our body through various conditions such as our parents and prior affinities with them. When the various conditions run their course, we must give up our bodies and disappear.Such is the nature of all things. Nothing lasts forever. Everything inexorably evolves toward its own demise.In other words, if we observe everything long enough, all things eventually return to emptiness. Thus, it is fair to conclude that everything is empty.By the way, Buddhism clarifies this point and suggests that if our planning horizon is long enough, we should take into account this emptiness concept and help to diminish our multitudes of attachments to things such as cars, houses, food, etc.Clearly, fewer attachments to worldly things make us more nimble (i.e. more clear headed), more at ease (i.e. have fewer worries), and happier (i.e. know contentment).What Is the Self?Again, that sophisticated person would proclaim that what we perceive as the Self, does not really exist.For example, if you consider that your body is the self (a rather common attitude), then what about our consciousness and soul? One could make the case that the intangible aspects of our existence are pretty important because we are more than a physical body, and certainly more lively than a corpse.In general, people have a rather unclear notion of the Self. Let’s face it, to the best of our knowledge, we know very little about our brain’s workings and capabilities.Never mind you might say: “I’m perfectly content with myself”. Why? “I have a good job; I’m in love with my husband, our children are well behaved, and we have a good family life.”Well, at the moment, the Self is content. Is it always the case? Were you this way before you had a family? What guarantees do you have that this can last?In Buddhism, we like to point out that the Self that is happy is the same Self that will change its mind and become unhappy when conditions change. Such are the ups and downs of life, you may say. We say: it’s not about life, it’s about the ego’s reaction to life. The more attachments we (our egos) have, the more things there are that can go wrong. Remember? Things inexorably deteriorate and so does our temporary contentment.On top of this nebulous notion of an ego, the Self, as we perceive it, is constantly evolving. That is, once we are past our youth, we begin to inch ever closer to emptiness (death, if you will) as time passes.In short, this Self of ours is both the source of happiness and unhappiness, depending on external conditions.To the Buddhist, the best way to put an end to all these gyrations and aberrations is to empty the Self.Emptying the SelfHow can the Self be emptied?No, we’re not advocating that you lose weight or give away your cherished organs!What it really means is that we should consider cutting off our attachments. Attachments to things that we consider important bog us down.Let’s face it: most of us practice selective memory retention. We prefer to magnify and day-dream about those two-minute rides at the fair. We conveniently choose to forget about the long wait that preceded it. Also, we quickly sweep under the rug the deflation we felt once the fun ended.Technically speaking, these various attachments make us scattered and create emotional ups and downs. Without such attachments, we would be able to enter samadhi (i.e. focus our mind) and enjoy the bliss of samadhi.Higher level practitioners can then gradually enter higher level of samadhis (i.e. increased concentration power). One such high level of samadhi is called “the Patience of Non-Production of Dharmas” where the ego stops functioning and the bliss is really inconceivable.That’s why the Buddhists understand the desirability of emptying the ego.​Doing so makes you happier.Have a happy day!"},{"title":"Be like Guan Yin Bodhisattva","content":"Guan Yin Bodhisattva is the enlightened being who symbolizes Great Compassion. She uses her spiritual powers to rescue living beings of the ten directions.

Living Beings in our Saha world have great affinity with her. She has a great record of effectively come to the rescue of all those who are suffering.​Sufferings come in limitless forms. They can however be classified to eight general kinds:1.  Suffering of birth: the moment the baby’s skin comes in contact with the ambient air, it really hurts! Maybe that’s why they tend to cry at birth. Never mind you might say. It’s at best a temporary unpleasant experience that most of us do not remember. Right you are, how about the:2.  Suffering of old age: our body no longer is willing to cooperate with us. We spend a lifetime nurturing it, pampering it and bestowing great generosities toward it. However, there will come a time where it no longer listens to our commands or requests. Don’t you hate it when you discover another furrow on our forehead or that additional strand of grey hair? Not only is the aging process most unnerving, it also has a seemingly inseparable buddy: the3.  Suffering of sickness: this body of ours seems to attract illnesses like honey attracts flies. When we were young, they tend to be manageable. As we get older they unfortunately seem to be increasingly more out of control. The average life span of the people who live in developed countries may appear to increase but their quality of life definitely seems to decrease by the forever increasing number of incurable illnesses. They are most disconcerting because they presage the:4.  Suffering of death: the ultimate fear factor for most living creatures. Like that cockroach that speedily scurries away from you out of fear that you might step on it or spray it with some kind of toxic materials, all of us want to put it off as long as we can. As to the5.  Suffering of being apart from the loved ones: when I was growing up in Vietnam, it’s not uncommon for my little sister to tear up whenever we went to the airport to see a family member off. Love feels good but also hurts, doesn’t it?6.  Suffering of being with those we hate: Don’t you hate it when you have to put up with someone you detest? Wouldn’t be good to be able to make him/her disappear from the face of the earth? Perhaps that where the inventors of those terrible atomic/hydrogen/neutron bombs got their inspiration.7.  Suffering of not able to get what we want: As long as we have desire, as long as we long for things, we inevitably suffer from profound disappointments. Wives often find that their husband do not understand them. Parents too often find their children to be ungrateful and naïve. Grand-parents all but must often resign to neglect from their offspring.8.  Suffering of the raging five skandhas: this is where I think Buddhism tends to get too far. It’s bad enough that the previous seven are that overwhelming. This one by far is the worst because we don’t even know that there is such kind of suffering: of form, feeling, thinking, activity and consciousness. I’ll spare you this one for now.If you find yourself in suffering, just remember to sincerely invoke Guan Yin Bodhisattva’s name. If you can do so with utmost sincerity, you get immediate relief!How come? It’s because that Bodhisattva thoroughly understands sufferings. She has a great understanding of sufferings after enduring all sorts of sufferings. Over time, she ended all her sufferings and resolved to help others end their sufferings. That’s her life’s purpose: put an end to living beings’ suffering.To those of us who are deeply indebted to her, I have a suggestion.

Seekers of happiness should therefore live their life according to the six worthy ways:      1. Keep Yourself Healthy and FitEveryone understands the importance of taking care of their health. This means that you should pay attention to your diet and, at the same time, maintain a regular exercise schedule to be fit.In particular, we highly recommend a more vegetarian diet. People simply fail to understand that a poor diet loads their bodies with toxins that cause illness. People who become vegetarians quickly discover improved health and increased energy.2. Be Wholesome in Every WayFurthermore, the importance of the mental health cannot be underestimated. Happiness is founded upon a good state of mind.Do away with negative thoughts such as envy, greed, arrogance, etc. Throw them out as you would venomous snakes. Negative thoughts will definitely cause great harm to you and your loved ones. Make no mistake about it, by nurturing unwholesome thoughts, you are teaching your children to be just like you!3. Listen to Those With More ExperienceLearn to seek advice from others, particularly those who have been around the block.Avoid reinventing the wheel and learn to trust experienced people. Be grateful when advice is offered.4. Learn from Those with More KnowledgeSeek out knowledgeable people. Find a mentor at work if you wish for a more solid and productive career.Respect those who can teach you because they can enrich your life. Learn to systematically seek out knowledgeable people to help point you to the right direction.5. Live According to TruthBe truthful.Truth is the basis for trust in all relationships. Trust is more important than material gains or benefits.6. Act With Sincerity, Not Just EnergyEnergy is another word for vigor, a necessary ingredient in ensuring that we can reach our goals.Sincerity calls for real action, not just promises.​For example, students who follow our meditation training over several years are living proof of the above-mentioned six worthy ways. They report being happier and satisfied – are you?"},{"title":"Spotting Good Knowing Advisors","content":"​What is a Good Knowing Advisor?Why is the ability to recognize GKAs important?​How Does One Recognize a GKA?​The term, good knowing advisor (GKA) comes from the Chinese 善知識 (shàn zhi shì). When I first started teaching, I abbreviated it to wise advisor but later reverted back to GKA because it is more appropriate.       What is a Good Knowing Advisor?Let’s break it down so we can understand what the wise Chinese patriarchs meant.Good 善 (shàn): This points out that the person is:A good person andKnows about goodness.Goodness is clearly defined by the Buddhist precepts (rules of morality). For example, a good person does not tell lies, does not steal from others, and does not indulge in acts of killing (even for sport).Goodness transcends cultural, temporal, and individual definition limits. For example, what is good in Africa must also be good in Latin America, in all times, and independent of individual interpretations.Knowing 知 (zhi): Knowledge comes with study. A knowledgeable person has invested time in the learning process. For example, the Sanghans of old were required to study the Buddhist moral precepts for five years, before they were allowed to learn Buddhist teachings or practice meditation.Today, however, novice left home people rarely invest much time in the study of Buddhist precepts, therefore, leaving them less qualified to be a GKA.Advisor 識 (shì): while knowing refers to internal development, advisor is its external counterpart. An advisor is able to recognize where you are and wisely direct your progress on your personal dharma path.Without the wisdom to perceive your personal environment and your personal mental and spiritual condition, an advisor cannot be very useful.In short, a GKA is a good person who knows what is best for you.Why is the ability to recognize GKAs important?This is a distinguishing characteristic of Mahayana cultivation.Cultivators with superior blessings tend to encounter teachers who urge them to look for good knowing advisors who can guide them in their practice.Why? If you are already wise and sure of yourself, there is no need for cultivation or a GKA. On the other hand, if you sometimes find yourself unable to cope with life’s complexities and pressures, you may want to consider cultivation. Cultivation enables you to contemplate challenges and difficulties from another perspective, making solutions apparent, thus improving the quality of your life.Further, Mahayana cultivation stresses the importance of learning under a GKA because:It saves time. Learning by trial and error can be an inefficient and trying process. Having a mentor can help you overcome difficulties quickly; allowing you to become proficient in your endeavors sooner than you could by yourself. This is true of both professional work and your spiritual cultivation.It is easier. With guidance, you avoid mistakes that could discourage you, thus, slowing or stopping your progress.You are made aware of personal shortcomings that you must overcome. Recognizing our deficiencies is often the most difficult part of making progress. The first step in turning on the lights is being aware that it is dark.Frankly, we should seek out GKAs until we reach Fourth Stage Arhatship. Until then, we can go astray and not even know it. In fact, many higher level cultivators prefer to cultivate under the direction and guidance of a GKA.How Does One Recognize a GKA?My late teacher, Great Master Xuan Hua who founded the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association was often asked this question.His answer was that GKAs are not greedy for:Fame: in particular, many Sanghans fall victim to this under the guise of aspiring to help more people. Famous individuals are not necessarily able to help more people. In fact, if you are attached to fame, your primary goal is to cultivate your ego, and do not have the wisdom to truly help others.Profit: if you’re attached to profits it is difficult to be impartial and you tend not to put the interests of others before your own. It also makes it difficult to accept a loss – a necessity when helping others.I have also asked this question over the years and often pondered my teacher’s answers. Today, I’ll add a few more to help those of you who are sincerely looking for GKAs.A GKA’s answers to your questions are amazingly simple and direct. If they are really wise, they can cut through the fog effortlessly. A Chinese saying states: “While confused, a thousand volumes are inadequate; after enlightenment, one word is too many.” For example, when I had my first personal audience with my late teacher, within one minute, Great Master Xuan Hua uttered a few sentences that allowed me to leave the home life under him, reassured me that everything would work out well, and transmitted to me my personal Dharma. I did not realize that he gave me my Dharma until ten years later, after his death. As a result, I will spend the rest of my life cultivating this particular Dharma Door. Now, that’s real wisdom and real foresight!GKAs tend to be left home people. I do know of quite a few very wise individuals who are lay people. When I asked why they do not teach, I was told that the BuddhaDharma is transmitted by Sanghans and not lay people. These folks are certainly qualified to be GKAs, yet they prefer to work behind the scene in supportive roles.I’m not sure how the other monks feel about it, but it does make me feel more humble and motivates me to cultivate more vigorously so as not to embarrass the sangha in front of these superior individuals.GKAs never hesitate to refer you to another GKA. You do not need to stealthily go behind a GKA’s back to seek the advice of another GKA. When the time comes, a true GKA recognizes that it is better for you to move on to greener pastures. For example, in chapter 39 of the Avatamsaka Sutra, titled “Entering the Dharma Realm”. Good Wealth Bodhisattva first met with Manjushri Bodhisattva and asked for instructions on how to become enlightened. Even though Manjushri could have easily taught Good Wealth everything himself, he instead referred Good Wealth to other GKAs who subsequently referred Good Wealth to other GKAs. Good Wealth followed their advice and learned from the referred teachers, and ultimately became enlightened.GKAs are grateful to their benefactors. Gratitude is the basis of humanity. Wise people recognize those to whom they are indebted and work hard to repay their kindness. In particular, GKAs often express gratitude toward their GKAs and the better GKAs are the ones who serve their own GKAs.​The more you learn about Mahayana, the more you’ll know how to recognize them. I’ve enumerated just a few points to help you get started. When you do find a GKA, please let me know so that I too have the opportunity to learn from a good and wise teacher."},{"title":"D&B Series Part 2: What Worthy Ones Want","content":"Manjushri, the wisest of all the Bodhisattvas, advocated practicing the Pure Land Dharma and vowed to be reborn to the Western Bliss Pure Land: “I vow at the end of my life, to extinguish all my afflictions, see Amitabha [come greet me], and be reborn to the Pure Land.”      Great Strength Bodhisattva was quoted in the Shurangama Sutra’s Great Strength’s perfect penetration chapter: “On my causal ground, I originally used the reciting the Buddha’s name mind to enter the Patience of Non-Production [become enlightened]; now in this world, I gather in those who recite the Buddha’s name and bring them back to the Pure Land.”Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, according to the Avatamsaka Sutra, is one of the Good Knowing Advisers that the Good Wealth Bodhisattva visited to request the Dharma for enlightenment. He told Good Wealth: “The Ten Great King Vows guide living beings to return to the Pure Land,” to accomplish the Buddha fruition.Vasubandhu Bodhisattva, in the Rebirth Shastra, taught the five Dharma Doors of bowing, praising, making vows, contemplating, and making transference. When they are cultivated to accomplishment, one will obtain rebirth in the Pure Land and see Amitabha Buddha.Dragon Tree Bodhisattva was quoted in a Shastra as saying: “The BuddhaDharma has countless Dharma Doors. Like worldly paths, some are difficult to cultivate and others are easy. To quickly attain the non-retreating ground, one should use the reverent mind to uphold and recite the Buddha’s name.”Ma Ming (Horse’s Cry) Bodhisattva, said in the Shastra of Bringing Forth the Faith: “The most expedient Dharma Door is to single-mindedly recite the Buddha’s name. It enables one to immediately obtain rebirth and non-retreat.”Clearly, they know something that we don’t. Shouldn’t we follow their lead?When I was a novice monk, one of my elder Dharma brothers proudly proclaimed that he did not wish to be reborn to the Pure Land! Why not? – because he intends to be reborn as a human and continue to cross over living beings.I was impressed by his magnanimous vow.However, I now realize that it was a marketing ploy. How can he be assured that he will return as a human being? At this point, he has not put an end to birth and death. In fact, he’s very far away from it! I doubt very much that he could become enlightened this lifetime! Until you become enlightened, you have no control over your revolution in the Wheel.I would rather aim for rebirth in the Pure Land, where the environment is ideal for cultivation. I vow not return to the Wheel and try to save others until after I become enlightened, so that I will know how to do it. I would rather not teach others when I’m confused because they will fare as well without me. Until I do become enlightened, it would be better (and safer) to teach and transmit the Patriarch’s teachings. I also advise my fellow left-home colleagues to seek out an enlightened teacher and cultivate under before venturing out on their own (like having their own temple or disciples); let’s not perpetuate our ignorance!"},{"title":"On Healing Illnesses","content":"Illness is part of life. From the Buddhist perspective, our bodies are impermanent.From the perspective of cause and effect, illnesses are retributions for prior offenses.​Illnesses are a form of debt settlement...      ​Illness is part of life.From the Buddhist perspective, our bodies are impermanent – in a progressive state of slow decay – sometimes hastened by illnesses. Otherwise, we would all be immortals and put the medical and death industries out of business.From the perspective of cause and effect, illnesses are retributions for prior offenses against other beings. For example, a person might have killed someone else in a prior lifetime. Now, the victim comes back for retribution in the form of an illness demon, such as cancer demon, making a claim against the reborn offender.Further, illnesses are a form of debt settlement. When the debt is repaid in full, we are healed. Minor colds are examples. They represent minor debts that are repaid by temporarily suffering through cold symptoms. This is the first form of healing; suffering through illnesses until recovery.There are two other ways we deal with illnesses.An obvious way is to seek help. We can get help from doctors, acupuncturists, healers, etc.Their effectiveness can also be explained with the law of cause and effect. The third party healer meddles with the illness (debt), and by helping to settle the debt, assumes part of the burden that the illness represents. For example, a cancer patient receiving chemotherapy obtains relief because the medical professionals take on and carry part of the cancer debt themselves. The healers tend not to complain because they believe that their compensation is an adequate exchange for their trouble. However, most do not realize that they then own some of their patients’ debt burden.It is also important to understand that patients, the original debtors, actually incur losses in the form of medical bills, insurance premiums and co-payments, cost of medications, transportation expenses, and resulting physical pain, psychological pain, or physical damage that they must endure for the remainder of their lives.Sometimes, healing technology is limited, therefore, the debt can only be settled through actual suffering as retribution for past offenses. For example, patients with mental illnesses are rarely healed. Two of my disciples suffered from clinical depression for a long time. When they began cultivating with us they succeeded in shaking off their depression ghosts.This is an illustration of the third and final option for healing—recovery through the accumulation of merit and virtues. There are two ways to achieve this:People can generate merit and virtues themselves through cultivation and good works. This will carry them out of the effective range of the creditors seeking retribution, thus resulting in self-healing.If one cannot cultivate or perform good works, one can accumulate merit and virtues with the help of the Triple Jewel (your local sangha member can advise you about this).How does this second option of creating external merit and virtue result in healing? Basically, the Triple Jewel (Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha) meddle on your behalf. They use merits and virtues that you create and negotiate your wellness with your creditors by passing your merits and virtues on to beings seeking retribution from you. It works because the results are mutually beneficial:The illness ghost or demon by accepts the generated merit and virtue through the Triple Jewel, relenting on the debt claim in lieu of retribution. They actually gain blessings rather than inflict damages/loss on the debtor.The debtor is healed and debt repaid.The Triple Jewel creates affinity with both sides.I prefer the third approach of healing through the creation of merit and virtue through the Triple Jewel because it is:Fair – We do recommend repaying our past debts. Running away from creditors only postpones repayment and interest continues to accrue until the debt is repaid in full. Our creditors may not as generous as the US Government, willing to extend credit at zero interest to banks during the recent 2009 credit crisis.Clean – By not running away from our past debts, we have the opportunity to resolve past enmities. We will all feel better.Efficacious – The best way to resolve past debts is for creditors to forgive them. We all suffer enough as it is already!​These concepts may be hard for the western-educated people to believe. Regardless, once they’ve tried all other options, I hope that they will consider the Buddhist merit and virtue option. My own students also first viewed it with suspicion. However, this being the sixth year of my Dharma propagation, no student has yet come to me to complain that I deceived them with this healing method."},{"title":"On Kindness","content":"​Newcomers to our lectures invariably ask: “What is the difference between Hinayana (Small Vehicle) and Mahayana (Big Vehicle) Buddhism?”Buddhism in general is about developing wisdom through lifestyle choices. The Hinayana practitioner awakens to one’s OWN suffering and chooses to end it by developing the Sage’s wisdom (called Fourth Stage Arhat). ​      On the other hand, the Mahayana practitioner also realizes that life can also be full of suffering and decides to end it by concentrating in developing wisdom to end suffering for ALL living beings.​In other words, the Hinayana wisdom is quite a bit narrower as compared to that of Mahayana. The Mahayana mindset is based on the four Unlimited Minds of Kindness, Compassion, Joy, and Renunciation.I’ll take this opportunity to elaborate a little bit on the first one: Kindness. We first and foremost start with developing a mind of kindness.Buddhist KindnessIn Mahayana Buddhism, kindness is called Unconditional Kindness, 無緣慈 in Chinese or \"Vô Duyên Từ\" in Vietnamese. Kindness is to give joy; unconditional means that we attach no conditions or affinity to those whom we offer it.How do we create affinity or conditions with others? We do it by giving something to them or by receiving something from them. Why is this called affinity or conditions? Think about it, when you give something to someone, like a bribe, it naturally makes that person more favorably predisposed towards you.How about taking from someone? It has a similar, but reverse effect: the recipient feels an obligation to repay. In addition, if you are like most people who give, you would like to hang around so that others recognize your generosity and you can bask in their admiration and adoration.Mahayana stresses unconditional kindness because it is more challenging to practice kindness on those with whom we have little or no affinity.Kindness’ Salient CharacteristicsWhy do we Buddhists start with giving joy? I’ll briefly offer a few reasons:1. In contrast to the typical approach of seeking personal happiness, that “unalienable right”, we understand the importance of making others happy. How long can you stay happy when your husband is unhappy? Similarly, when you make your kid happy, doesn’t it invariably make you happy too? As you can see, the secret of happiness is to focus on making others happy rather than pleasing yourself.  ​Now, let me ask: what have you done today to bring a smile to your mother’s face?​2. Unlike common wisdom, Buddhists don’t fall in love with “being right”. Instead, we prize kindness to others. Wait a minute, the reason we get an education and keep our knowledge up-to-date, isn’t that for the purpose of recognizing and doing the right thing? Let’s think about it, when you courted your wife, was it based on showing your intellectual prowess or was it based on making her laugh and feel that she was the only person in the world for you? OK, OK, now that you’ve both awakened to that initial phoniness that was probably motivated by animal impulses and urges, the wise thing is to go back to reason, right?How often do you argue with your spouse to prove that you are right? Even when you are in the right, is he or she really convinced and converted to your side? Let me suggest that if you win most of these disagreements, you are probably on your third or fourth relationship and have not yet figured out why you are such a loser at love when you are right so often. Or, if you’re on the losing end of most disagreements, don’t you hate it when your significant other is right so often?But what about doing the right thing? Right is very relative to the individual’s perspective. What is right for a Muslim is not necessarily right for someone with a different religious belief. Does it then make it OK for us to impose ourselves on others? The Iraq war is such an eloquent testament to such foolishness.In other words, instead of focusing our proving that we are right, we should instead be focusing on what is right for others. Have you noticed that when we make them happy, we are on the right? More importantly, so are they! And they will be the last one to argue against that!3. It is important to understand that proving that you are right, or insisting that you are, is a form of aggression. No wonder you are so lonely, unpopular, and unhappy! One of my students is stuck on such an erroneous premise. He feels that he must be on the right so that his young son can know right from wrong. One weekend, he brought his kid to the temple because he could not find a babysitter. Would you be surprised if I told you that his kid was very happy and bounced from individual to individual, but would not go near his dad? Since I was so busy dealing with adults, I hardly had time to spend with the boy. All I could do was to shine my kindness mindset toward him. And, a strange thing happened: the second time that the boy attended the dharma assembly, before the family left, he came to me and adoringly hugged my left leg with all of his three foot frame. 4. At a deeper level, kindness is the basis for all goodness. If you want to know whether or not you are a good person, just look at how kind you can be. Can you do good without kindness? This is why the Mahayanist, whose goal is to help others, starts with kindness.UnlimitedFinally, let’s not forget that it’s about unlimited kindness.Why unlimited? Because:It’s not only limited to the ones we know and like, but also to those we don’t know nor particularly like. In fact, we are kind to all living beings!It’s not limited by amount; one does not arbitrarily start with a preset quota or initial limit. It thus helps us become aware of our stinginess.Nor do we set a time limit. If you have such an approach, you have no patience whatsoever! You are not good company. Nor would people come to you for a sympathetic ear or a shoulder to cry on!Nor are we limited by space: we spread goodness everywhere we go, in a most quiet and low-key fashion.Now you know – kindness is the key to your personal happiness."},{"title":"D&B Series Part 1: That Utmost Important Matter in Life","content":"Long ago, a young prince, who was in his twenties, succeeded his father to the throne of the empire. The new emperor highly valued wisdom. He understood the importance of using wisdom to rule his people. Therefore he instructed his faithful teacher to travel the world over to bring back the best of all the other cultures’ teachings.      So off the teacher went with a caravan of more than a hundred people, in search of the world’s wisest teachings.The young emperor turned out to be a great and kind ruler. But in the back of his mind, he felt as if something was still missing in his understanding. So he eagerly awaited his teacher’s return which did not happen until a good thirty years later.The wise teacher presented the emperor with hundreds of carts that carried all the teachings of the world. The wise ruler enthusiastically asked: “what have you learned?” The wise teacher said: “Please give me ten years to study these books and annals written by the wisest men of the world”. He was so ordered.The erudite man studiously went about his task for a decade. He then reported to the king: “I can explain my understanding to you in three years”. The emperor said: “I don’t have three years; please summarize it further for me”.The wise teacher thus mulled over his understanding for a few more years and one day, yelled “Eureka !” and ran to the emperor’s quarters shouting: “I’ve got it, I’ve got it!”By then the emperor was an old man who was lying on his death bed. His eyes shone brightly, feebly smiled and asked his teacher: “What is that that I need to understand?”The old teacher triumphantly extolled:” Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death”.It was as if a light bulb went off in the old emperor’s head and he smiled broadly and said: “Ah, I see, I see! Now I can go”. And he passed away.Had the old man looked into the Lotus Sutra, he would have found out that Buddhas are only concerned about that one matter: birth and death. Why are Buddhas of the three periods of time worried? Because living beings are like children who are so enthralled with games that they are oblivious to the fact that their house is burning and thus ended up perishing in the flames.What People of The World Indulge InWhat kind of games captivates the minds of people of the world?Some indulge in food. Eating not only provides comfort, it also provides them with tremendous pleasure. They therefore search the world over for more flavors. They tend to overeat, gain weight and thus load themselves up with diseases. It’s not uncommon for well-to-do societies to have significant obesity problems. Food indulgence results in health issues and shortens life.Quite often, eating pleasure must be accompanied by sleep. In fact, an ancient Asian wisdom says that foremost is sleep then eating comes in second. Although sleep serves the important purpose of allowing the body’s cells repair damage and grow, worldly people tend to oversleep. The conventional medical wisdom of seven hours of sleep at night is nonsense. People thus waste a significant portion of their life in sleep.Some people seek fame. They go to great lengths to obtain other people’s approval and adoration. They ruin their health, sacrifice personal relationships and family life in that pursuit. One of my students who is a performer recounted that once after a performance his audience was so responsive that it felt even better than sexual pleasure.I explained to him that it was because he has yet to meet that special person with whom sex is tremendously fulfilling. As a result, people tend to be overly possessive and often bring pain and misery to the people they love most. Furthermore, the pursuit of sexual gratification has led to countless fighting among men, the starting of wars and toppling of empires.Most people are obsessed with money because it gives us a sense of security and control. A good number of people enjoy hoarding wealth. They would stop at nothing for the sake of financial gains. In the process they inflict damages to society and ruin other people’s lives. Personal gains are often at someone else’s losses. The worst aspect of being rich is that one tends to lose a bit of humanity. When rich and powerful folks look at you, they tend to see another potential tool for them to make more money rather a fellow human being to be respected and cherished.What People of The World Are Oblivious to​We all know the importance of setting goals in life. Why? Because otherwise, life would have no purpose. At least that’s what people in the know say.There are people with lofty ideals who spend their lives in the pursuit of doing generous and virtuous deeds. They are respected and loved by the rest of us commoners.Yet, all of us must eventually face the music. We all will eventually come to the end of the road. We are all well prepared for the journey thanks to savvy goal setting and judicious management of our resources. But we all are ill prepared for Death. It is a lot more frightening than people would like to believe.People therefore spend their lifetime solving their life’s problems but smartly ignore the death issue because knowledge of it is obscured, as though there is a wall that prevents the passage of information.In Buddhism, there is the concept of reincarnation, which basically describes the process of death and birth, cycling through various realms of existence in accord with retribution for our own past karma. If one creates good karmas, then one can be reborn into the good paths like the human realm or god. On the other hand, creating bad karmas will set our course for rebirth in the evil realms of animals, hungry ghosts, and hells.Birth in the good realms results in life spans of hundreds (e.g. humans), thousands (e.g. immortals) or millions (e.g. gods) of years. Whereas falling into the lower realms, such as the hells, will provide us the privilege of keeping company with mean hell employees who love to torture us for eons on end.We are thus captivated by life’s pleasures and completely ignore the big picture. Let’s face it: you invest your life to have a reasonably enjoyable 80 years of life. In the process of fulfilling your personal desires, you create bad karmas that will most likely make you fall into the lower realms for eons on end. Is it worth it? If you possess such longer-term vision you’d probably drastically alter your investment strategy, wouldn’t you?That wise emperor was a good and kind man who helped improve his subjects’ lives. But he failed to improve their next birth’s prospects. Sadly, like him, by the time we must face Death, it’s too late to do anything about it.I submit to you: people of the world who are oblivious to that ultimate ending of Death are not wise. They simply do not know how to live."},{"title":"Healing Cube","content":"There are three overlapping aspects of healing:From the Western Medicine Perspective (healing 1)From the Eastern Medicine Perspective (healing 2)From the Buddhist Perspective (healing 3)      I grew up with a penchant for Chinese Gongfu movies. To this date, there are still some cable channels that specialize in showing such movies.Their plot is typically simplistic. The good guys have a martial arts school in a small town. The bad guys show up, thrash the dojo, kill the head master and seriously injure the hero who barely escapes with his life. He nurses his wounds, swears revenge, and refines his gongfu skills. He appears from his hideout, thrashes the bad guys’ place, and the bad dudes all die a gory death.The appeal of such movies lies in their simple plot. As I watched, I quietly approved of the revenge: it seemed just and right that good won over evil, even though the bad guys frequently suffered painful deaths. Intuitively, it seems right that there should be payback for doing evil and/or committing offenses. Such is the law of cause and effect: inflict pain and suffering and thou shalt endure pain and suffering, destroy and thou shalt be destroyed.Now that I’ve become a left home person, I encounter many people who came to me because they have had illnesses that were incurable. It seems that going to the temple is one of the last stops in their desperate search for healing.I tend to take the opportunity to talk to them about the law of cause and effect. I try to explain to them that from the Buddhist perspective, sickness is retribution for offenses committed in the past. For example, kill a rabbit and you must undergo the equivalent pain and suffering that you inflicted on that innocent animal. After all, doesn’t it seem fair to you? Remember those Chinese gongfu plots? Kill and destroy and it’s just and right that you suffer similar destruction and death!There are three overlapping aspects of healing:1. From the Western Medicine Perspective (healing 1):The Western medicine specializes at dissecting illnesses and removing the defective parts. They excel at treating symptoms of diseases. No matter how skilled they become at locating and isolating the causes of problems, their approach is still limited in effectiveness. That is why, when combined with the Eastern medicine, their healing effectiveness drastically increases.2. From the Eastern Medicine Perspective (healing 2):Healing has a more systemic perspective (the extra dimension “squares” it). The Eastern medicine looks at illnesses as imbalances of the body. While they may not be as good as the Western medicine in local treatment, they tend to be more effective at prevention and comprehensive healing.For example, when engaged in a battle, don’t we have battle fronts and headquarters? If we focus only on the front line, we can be assured that the enemy will return. Or, it may appear that we are winning the battle, but in fact, the enemy is simply shifting its forces in a flanking effort to win the bigger war.One superior aspect of the Eastern medicine approach is the concept of Qi: that life force that flows through clearly defined energy channels inside our bodies. Illnesses are caused by that Qi being blocked in various places. This is why one can be healed through the unblocking of blockages through herbal medicine, acupuncture, acupressure, or exercise.While the combined approaches of Eastern and Western medicine offer tremendous advantages, they still cannot handle mental illnesses.3. From the Buddhist Perspective (healing 3):This is because neither of the above approaches can get to the root of the problems: they still are stuck at manifestations and symptoms.Many healers fail to realize that illnesses are caused by ghosts and spirits (yin world). These entities invade our bodies, causing Qi energy to be blocked, which then manifests as deterioration of the specific body parts.In other words, removing the defective body part or unblocking the Qi alone does not fix the root source of the problem.When Great Master Xuan Hua was alive, he could provide healing by chasing away these ghosts and spirits. People with incurable diseases would be healed with his help. My late grandmother was also healed by him after the Western and Eastern medicine doctors had given up hope for her recovery.That is why, when the Venerable Xuan Hua was still in the world, many people would seek him out for help. By the time he left us, his body was thus riddled with diseases and he was in great agony. This is probably because people did not realize that when he agreed to help, he basically meddled in their affairs and thus had to die on their behalf. After all, someone has to die or suffer in order for a karmic debt to be settled!At any rate, what does this have to do with healing your sicknesses?Understand that illnesses are a form of debt settlement. Because we inflicted pain and suffering in the past, e.g. through a killing karma, we now must undergo our retribution. Be careful about creating killing offenses!The retribution manifests as destruction of our body and assets as well as pain and suffering for us and loved ones. This is why people in the medical profession tend to have illnesses because when they earn their living by healing others, they are meddling in the debt settlement process, and thus assume the responsibility for part or all of the debt repayment.The lucky and more blessed ones may encounter Mahayana and receive help. They may be instructed to create merit and virtues for healing purposes. In many instances, these vengeful ghosts and spirits may listen to reason and might accept these merit and virtues as repayment in lieu of inflicting pain and suffering on those who owe them. It’s the proverbial win-win scenario: swapping destruction for blessings, or pain and suffering for Dhyana bliss.​On the other hand, there are many who refuse to believe in ghosts and spirits. They would not be willing to try it out even at the cost of their own lives and/or resign themselves to their state of misery and sufferings. Perhaps they too insist on continuing to inflict pain and suffering on their loved ones to settle past debts."},{"title":"Thanks for Giving","content":"​This month is the month of Thanksgiving in the United States of America. It is the time when most of its residents, whose ancestors were immigrants, get together to celebrate and express gratitude for the many gifts bestowed upon them.      As a first-generation immigrant and left-home person, I too would like to express my thanks for:The founders of this great country who created a system that is the model of the world, enabling the cream to rise to the top. I’m particularly thankful for the separation of the Church and State doctrine. This allows us to engage in spiritual pursuits with minimal interference from the State. For that, this humble monk and his followers will do our best not abuse the system, especially its tax code, by not encouraging improper or illegal tax deductions. In fact, we encourage our followers to pay their taxes and discourage them from tax evasion, which is an infraction of our Buddhist morality code. To repay the national founders’ kindness, we vow to strive to build on the system and refrain from damaging or destructive practices.The people of this nation who most generously extended a lending help to this ignorant foreign student and repeatedly overlooked his many blunders. I am very grateful to the many individuals such as our troops, whom I’ve never met who made untold personal sacrifices so that I can enjoy my many liberties and privileges. I have had the opportunity to meet with people from upper to lower strata: I’m most impressed with the goodness and kindness in their hearts. For that, we try to share our understanding and knowledge for the betterment of the people’s lives. Our students are gradually discovering more effective alternative approaches to their problems/illnesses. Cultivation improves their lives and brings peace, bliss and joy to their lives and loved ones’.My magnanimous teachers, Ven. Xuan Huà of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas and Ven. Mãn Giác of Viet-Nam temple, I cannot fully express my profound gratitude. As I am beginning to accept disciples, I now realize that it’s a thankless task. They both have left our world. I would have given up the world to spend more time to learn from them. I deeply regret not having enough blessings to draw near them longer.​When Shakyamuni Buddha announced to his disciples that he was about to enter Nirvana, his disciples came from far away places to pay their last respects. Throngs hustled for a time slot to say their personal good-bye’s to the World-Honored-One. However, amongst the Buddha’s resident disciples, there was a monk who made no such attempt. Instead, he would shut himself in his room away from all the commotion. His colleagues wasted no time in bringing the matter up to Shakyamuni and entreated the Baghavan to punish him. He was therefore called to the Buddha’s room to explain his behavior. He said: “World-Honored-One, since you don’t have much time left with us, I thought that the best way to express my gratitude is to meditate and work hard at my cultivation. I hope to realize Arhatship before you leave so that you won’t feel that you’ve wasted your time teaching me.” The Buddha beamed and proclaimed: “He who loves me most, most vigorously puts my teachings into practice”.I vow to try harder to live up to the standards set by my teachers. I beseech them to be patient with my repeated failures in such endeavors.Happy Holidays!"},{"title":"The French Lieutenant’s Woman","content":"​The Asian culture has innumerable stories of responses from reciting the Buddha’s name. Below is such a story.Most Asian Buddhist practitioners are quite familiar with the Buddha’s name recitation method. Many already recite the (Amitabha) Buddha’s name. The Asian culture has innumerable stories of responses from reciting the Buddha’s name. Below is such a story.      This happened in when Vietnam was a French colony. A French lieutenant fell in love with a young Vietnamese girl. She was from a wealthy family and graduated from a French high school in Vietnam. Naturally, her family was opposed to the relationship and threatened to disown her.The lovers ignored all the objections. On Sundays, she’d wear her “áo dài” (traditional Vietnamese long robe) and bring him to the temple to pray to the Buddha’s name. She’d teach him to offer incense, to hold his arms together and together they’d kneel and recite the Buddha’s name, asking for help and guidance. The young lieutenant didn’t believe any of it, he simply went along because he just wanted to be with her.After she got married to her beloved French pilot, she moved into the military compounds with him because her family renounced her. They’d live happily like young people in love.Once, the lieutenant went to evening patrol with his co-pilot. They flew to the seep sea. The weather was bad, visibility was very low and the air very choppy. The airplane had engine trouble and they were forced to make a crash landing on the sea.As the plane started to sink, the young lieutenant reminisced of his lovely wife. He knew that she’d be at home, had finished preparing dinner and waited for him to come home. She’d also be sincerely reciting the Buddha’s name to pray for his safety as she usually did whenever he took to the air. During these last few moments of his life, he felt great love for his wife. Oh, what he’d be willing to give to be with her! Since he couldn’t be with her in body, he decided to be with her in soul: so he put his palms together and started piously reciting the Buddha’s name.Then something amazing happened: the plane stopped sinking! His co-pilot also noticed and asked him what he was doing. Thereupon, the both of us started earnestly reciting the Buddha’s name. Within an hour’s time, a freighter passed by and rescued them. As they got on the boat, they looked and found that their plane then disappeared into the dark waters!The more sincerely you recite the Buddha’s name, the more likely you could get your own response!"},{"title":"Your Best Friend","content":"Have you ever had a friend who is your soul mate? He or she intimately knows your likes and dislikes, the kind of person who can complete your sentences for you, one whom you would trust your wife and children, or your own life…   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t       Zhi Yin: the Chinese versionMy late Master, Venerable Thích Mãn Giác explained the Chinese concept of best friend to me ten years ago when he first allowed me to become a fully ordained monk. I no longer remember the exact names he used, so please forgive my poor memory: no disrespect is intended.Long ago, in China, there was a high level official. He excelled at playing the ancient Chinese guitar. He was so good that he could find no one to appreciate his virtuosity. He therefore often would hop onto his boat and travel to distant places to play his Chinese guitar by himself.One day, he stopped by the bank of a river in a very isolated place, and played his musical instrument. After he finished, he heard someone sigh loudly and say: “such a virtuoso – yet how can someone this gifted feel so lonely!” That was exactly what he felt when he chanced upon the deserted place; how sad have the ability to produce such beautiful music but not be able to find someone to appreciate it. The official looked up and saw a hermit sitting atop a rock above the river banks. They started talking, forgot about time, and became the best of friends.Later, the official returned to work in the city. Afterward he hurriedly returned to the river bank to find his new friend at the first chance he could get away.Alas, he looked and looked, but his hermit friend was nowhere to be found. Finally, he was told that his hermit friend had passed away.The official sadly went back to his boat, grabbed his guitar and broke it into pieces. He never played the guitar again.That is why the Chinese term for best friend is zhi yin 知 音 (Tri Âm in Vietnamese). Zhi 知 means to know; Yin 音 means sound. A best friend is one who knows your sound.A Lifetime ThirstI remember the story because my Master told it to me in the most affectionate way. I was very lucky to have such a magnanimous teacher. I still feel sad that I was not able to spend more time with him before he passed away.Moreover, the story was memorable for another reason. All my life, I have always had this thirst: to be able to find a best friend, a zhi yin (tri âm). I have always felt a void in my soul that no girlfriend, wife, or male friend could ever fill.He Finally Showed Up​Years later, as I devoted more time and effort to cultivating the Pure Land Dharma, I began reciting Amitabha Buddha’s name with increasing fervor.Then, one night, I recited his name and he suddenly appeared, flanked by Guan Yin and Great Strength Bodhisattvas. He gently rubbed the crown of my head. At that moment, an indescribable feeling welled up in my heart.The following day, I realized that my lifelong thirst for a zhi yin was suddenly quenched: my best friend, Amitabha Buddha, finally came to me, upon my calling his name.I hope that you too will have Amitabha Buddha as a zhi yin."},{"title":"A War Story","content":"​Until we are reborn to the Pure Lands, how do we address our current life’s problems, like sicknesses, disasters, seeking a son or daughter, seeking wealth and good health, etc.?The Other Often Neglected BuddhaWho else? That’s Akshobya Buddha or more commonly known as Medicine Master Buddha of the Eastern Vaidurya Pure Land.      When people speak of the Pure Land practice, it’s often construed to be recitation of Amitabha Buddha’s name to seek rebirth in his Western Bliss Pure Land. Many do not realize that Shakyamuni Buddha also transmitted the other Pure Land Dharma – Medicine Master Buddha Dharma. Practice it and you can be reborn in the Pure Lands: his Eastern Pure Land or Amitabha’s Western Pure Land.There is another very important reason why Shakyamuni Buddha taught the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma, especially to help Living Beings in the Dharma Image and Dharma Ending Ages. Until we are reborn to the Pure Lands, how do we address our current life’s problems, like sicknesses, disasters, seeking a son or daughter, seeking wealth and good health, etc.?Have no fear. The Medicine Master Buddha is already here to help lengthen life, quell disaster and boost our blessings.Since we started cultivating the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma, we have been quite lucky – many of our students obtained responses quite rapidly.Cultivating to Help DependentsI have a disciple, named W; he and his wife have been white collar professionals for decades.As a lead design engineer for a large multi-national firm, he’s under great stress. He has been practicing yoga for many years to help with his health.A year ago, he decided to try our Chan class that started in February. We also happened to start lecturing on the Medicine Master Buddha Sutra in the afternoons.He made progress very quickly. From zero samadhi, he quickly reached second Dhyana within a few months. He then decided to take refuge with the Triple Jewel and receive the Five Precepts.He had to fill out an application form. When asked why he wanted to take refuge, his reply was not along the lines of lofty goals like to become enlightened or save the world. His only desire in cultivation was to unfold his wisdom to help his two sons.​In our second weekly meeting, he expressed concern about his oldest son, B, who had announced that he intended to join the Marines that summer [2008] to fight the war in Iraq. He and his wife did not know how to talk B out of it.As they soon learned about the Medicine Master Dharma, they realized that it can eradicate war disasters. W, therefore, decided to purchase a Medicine Master plaque for B. Very shortly afterwards, W approached me and said that B had firmed up his mind to go to Iraq to fight the war: “He [B) is serious [about enlisting]. I don’t think he [B] is doing it in order to spite us [W. and his wife]. Could you please have a talk with him?”I agreed to try, even though I really did not expect a positive result – mostly because it seemed too late. This process had taken years for this very smart and strong-willed individual to arrive at his decision.The conversationA week later, B arrived, as arranged, on a Friday afternoon. Following is a brief account of our meeting.He rang the door bell of my place and appeared to be in a good frame of mind.We went to sit in the living room, but he refused my offer of tea or refreshments.I: Nice to see you again.B: Thank you for seeing me.I: When I saw you three years ago [when you’re in the 12th grade], your hair was shorter.B: Was it that long ago?I: What can I do for you?B: My parents suggested that I should have a talk with you. It’s not only their idea – I also was interested in meeting with you.They had already asked my younger brother, one of B.’s professors at college, to give it a tryI: Oh?B: This isn’t just their idea only.I: Why?B: I noticed that as soon as my parents started studying Buddhism with you, they changed overnight.I: For the better I hope?B: Yeah. We get along much better. Don’t get me wrong. I have great respect for both my parents. I admire their professional and financial success. But I think they’re happier.I: They’re concerned about you, especially about your plans for the future. Are you going to college now?B: Yeah, but I’ve been in and out. I just have no respect for my college teachers.I: I don’t blame you. It’s hard to find a good State University professor nowadays, who has both the intellectual capacity and samadhi power. [B had already reached first Dhyana – both his parents started at zero: they did not have enough mental strength to create a good impression on B’s strong mind].B: I refuse to fit in, to serve the institution. I just don’t see myself living like that.I: But you’re still young. Sometimes, one has to pay one’s dues before one’s turn comes. You’ll change your mind when you have a family to feed and loved ones to take care of.B: Perhaps, I’m sure there are ways to contribute without compromising myself.I: I hope that you’ll find your path.B: Me too. I still have time.I: I heard you’re going to Iraq to fight the war. Isn’t that serving the institution?B: It’s different.I: How so?B: It’s something I must do before I can do anything else.I: Would you mind explaining to me your reasons?B: I’ve thought long and hard about it. It’s to prove that I can do it. Until I pass this test, my life would be meaningless.I: A test of manhood? To see if you can survive danger and hardship?B: Yeah.I: That’s a true test of bravery.B: Just a thing that I must do.I: So you’ll be killing a lot of young children.B: Not necessarily. I hope to land in the recon (naissance) team. They don’t often engage in battles in populated areas.I: So you’ll be killing a lot of young children’s fathers.B: It may happen. It’s part of war.I: That’s some test. You’re quite gutsy. I admire that.B: Thank you.I: Have you considered the flip side?B: What do you mean?I: That you might get hurt.B: It could happen.I: You’re probably mentally prepared to pay that price, but what about your family? Suppose you come back seriously wounded, let’s say that you become an invalid. I’m sure that your parents would welcome you home and will take care of you until they die. You know how much they love you. Let’s say that you lose part of your face after you come back home. You’ll find your parents and younger brother ecstatic that you’re alive and at home. They would lovingly take care of you, of their hero who helped the family pay its debts to this great country.B: Yeah, it would probably be quite hard on them.I: But they’ll be the last ones to tell you. You know, your young brother who’s always looked up to you. He’ll be so glad to spend more time with you. But when he retires to his room, his heart is probably broken into a million pieces. He’d cry to himself saying: “Dear God, what have you done to my beloved brother? He used to be so handsome and full of life!”B: [thoughtfully silent]I: Have you considered the price your family has to pay should you come back seriously wounded? Are you willing to submit them to such tests?B: I guess they would be devastated.I: For the rest of their lives.B: That would be terrible.I: We all have to face our tests. Have you considered other kinds of tests?B: Like what?I: Like the kind that should you fail, it would not place such a heavy toll on your family for your failure.B: Such as…?I: There are plenty of tests, or rites of passage (to manhood). Actually, there are much better tests which are constructive instead of being destructive. We don’t need to destroy or inflict pain on others to prove our toughness and/or our superiority.B: I guess so.I: I can think of so many such tests. When you think under such lights, you’ll surely discover plenty of them. I can give you one right now that you won’t believe is one such test.B: Yeah. Please tell me.I then lifted my monk’s precept sash to show that my legs were locked in full lotus – for a couple of hours by then.I: This is an extremely tough practice that most people fail. It can hurt a lot and yet no one knows.B: I must admit that my mind was made up when I first came. Now I’m not so sure.B later took leave of me. I told him that I was impressed, that his head was screwed on right, and that he would be all right.Until today, I have not told anyone about this encounter. When his mother asked me about our meeting, I told her that I did not want to say anything until B made up his mind, because I did not want to influence his decision in any way.A few weeks later, he came to visit his parents and announced to his family that he had abandoned his plan to go to war. He asked his father to help finance his training to be an emergency room medical technician. His father’s immediate reply was: he’s got it. So B changed from going to war in Iraq to going to war with death in the emergency room. He went from risking his life for a short-term to risking it professionally. What character!The moral of the story: I was most amazed with B’s receptiveness because I know many much more intelligent and savvy people have tried to counsel B. After I agreed to meet with B, I honestly had no idea what to expect or what to say. Apparently, we were able to temporarily postpone B’s killing habit energies [from prior lifetimes]. Who knows what else this bright and determined young man will dream of to test himself! It’s my sincere hope that he’ll apply himself in an industry which builds rather than destroys.Had it not been for Medicine Master Buddha’s help, this foolish monk would not have been able to add much. Personally, I’m resigned to it: people don’t come to us until they have gone through the best and the brightest.I can tell you my secret: miracles come from the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas who are just too modest to claim credit for themselves.Faithfully yours,​SYH"}]
