# Stomach Growls When Meditating

Question:Ven. Master,I have been contemplating my breath as per your instruction. I need further direction because I think ran into some problems:I inhale and expand my tummy, hold my breath for 2-5 seconds and then exhale. Often when I hold my breath, my stomach starts making bubbling noises even as air comes out from my mouth. While I contemplate my breath, I feel very comfortable. If I prevent the air from escaping then I feel a little bit of discomfort. Also, I pass gas while I meditate but I still feel as comfortable as before.Is there anything wrong with my practice? Please clarify it for me. After I started following your meditation methodology, I feel better and can sleep better. For that I am very grateful and wish you great health.Respectfully,​TA      Answer:For the past few weeks, you have been working hard, following the instructions of our Chan Handbook.You indicated that you have meditated for years and that you had not yet experienced the above-described states; is that correct? There is nothing to worry about. Those are good states.​Keep up the good work.
