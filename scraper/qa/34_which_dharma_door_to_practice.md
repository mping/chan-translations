# Which Dharma Door to Practice

Question:Ven. Master,You are teaching Chan and Pure Land Paralled cultivation. Ven. Hang Truong, also a disciple of Great Master Xuan Hua, is teaching Integral Taichi, meditation and other practices. ​​​Nowadays, at The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, what is that Dharma Door? Ven. Hang Dat is also a disciple of Great Master Xuan Hua, what Dharma Door is he teaching? ​Ven. Master, please instruct me which Dharma Door I should learn.      Answer:I sympathize with his frustrations about the different teaching approaches of the various disciples of Great Master Xuan Hua.Unfortunately, I am unqualified to comply to his request because I have no time to look at other temples’ teaching approaches. I am primarily interested in teaching my followers what they can absorb in order to end their suffering and attain bliss.​He should take the time to investigate and compare the various approaches:If they are not consistent with Master Xua Hua’s teachings then he should distance himself from such a teacher.Furthermore, the results should speak for themselves. He should stick to an approach that works for him, that helps speed him along toward Buddhahood. After all, isn’t that what matters?”
