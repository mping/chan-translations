# Hands and Eyes

Question:For the past few days, I have been practicing the Hands & Eyes Dharma that I found on the internet but I have yet to see any results.Ven. Master, am I committing any offense in practicing this Hands & Eyes Dharma, regardless if I succeed or fail?Please kindly instruct me.Emituofo,​PS: This email I gave is a fake one so that I could submit this question      Answer:I strongly advise you to stop practicing the Hands & Eyes Dharma in question for the following reasons:The Hands & Eyes Dharma must be officially transmitted to you before you can practice it.The information on the internet is most likely unreliable because either it is inaccurate or it does not have the details on how to practice this Dharma properly. For example, in all the literature that I found published on the 42 Hand & Eye Dharma, I have never found the instructions on how to practice it. The instructions were orally transmitted to me and not written down anywhere.To practice this Dharma without receiving proper transmission is to commit “Theft of the Dharma”. This means that you will never be able to receive the results that you desire. Worse yet, now that you know it is wrong, if you persist in practicing this Dharma, you will never be able to receive transmission of the Hands & Eyes Dharma in the future.You should stop practicing this Dharma immediately. Please forgive this stupid monk if my straight words offend you.
