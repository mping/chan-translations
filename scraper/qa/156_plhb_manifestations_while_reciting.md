# [PLHB] Manifestations while reciting

Question:​In the evening, when I recite the Buddha’s name, there often are strange occurrences. Why is that so?       Answer:Those are from the invisible beings who manifest or make their own presence felt.Reciting the Buddha’s name creates a lot of merit and virtue for living beings in the area. Therefore, some of them may manifest to express gratitude or laud the good deed.When they get to hear the Buddha’s name, the seeds are registered into their Alaya consciousness which will offer them a chance for rebirth to Amitabha Buddha’s Pure Land in the future.For instance, someone had many abortions in her younger days.Consequently, she has been constantly tormented and felt oppressed.“They” seem to generate a lot of noise and disturbances in the mind. She once turned on our recitation of the Buddha’s name and suddenly, “they” stopped making noises. She further felt like her arms are being caressed. She then told “them” to behave in order for the master to consent to help get them to the Pure Land. “They” since behaved.​Not only are we sharing space with those invisible beings, they often come and manifest in order to ask us to help them attain liberation or rebirth to the Pure Land.
