# Only Wish to Recite Buddha Name

Question:Ven. Master:I hope that you will instruct me because I do not know much about Buddhism.In the morning, I would like to bow to the Buddha for 15 minutes but do not wish to recite the Sutras. Can I just only recite the Buddha’s name and bow to the Buddha?Thank you for your instructions.​BTND ​      Answer:You are doing just fine.I would suggest the following minor considerations:Please listen to audio files on the Proper Dharma. For example, do that while driving to work: that will naturally help you get more exposure to Mahayana while minimizing for your false thinking. In particular, you should listen to all of my late teacher’s Dharma Talks audio files because they are very insightful.Make sure to dedicate the merit and virtue of your daily cultivation as per the following link to our web site.If you do the above, you will eventually enjoy bowing and reciting the Buddha’s name a lot more. And naturally, you will also like reciting Sutras such as the Small Amitabha Sutra.Keep up the good work!
