# Non-Vegetarian Reciting the Buddha’s Name

Question:Ven. Master!Please help clarify for me the following:1. I have been reciting the Buddha’s name for quite a while, but because of scheduling conflicts from work, I have not been able to do it at specific times. ​​Usually, I recite the Buddha’s name all the time everywhere: whether it be while walking or working with my hands. I wonder whether or not such recitations would be beneficial at all because I fear that I have been calling out to him instead of reciting his name.2. Often while I eat meat and fish I would recite his name: am I committing offenses? My question is if I recite the Buddha’s name but I am not a vegetarian, would I be committing offenses?I hope that you would kindly instruct me.​NTL      Answer:Thank you for sharing your concerns with us.You are doing just fine by reciting the Buddha’s name whenever you can during the day. It would be more beneficial to recite his name with utmost respect and faith because his name represents the kindest and most wholesome thought that your mind can formulate.There is no offense in reciting the Buddha’s name while eating. After you become more adept at it, you will naturally lose desire for meat and fish because your mind will become more compassionate and pure.
