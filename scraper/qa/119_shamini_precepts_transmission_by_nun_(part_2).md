# Shamini Precepts Transmission by Nun (part 2)

Question:Does it mean that bhikshunis cannot transmit shamini precepts either? Why won’t the precept substance be transmitted? Emituofo.​GTV       Answer:In some cases, Bhikshunis are allowed to transmit precepts.However, it is not advisable to go deeper into this matter because it’s really not for public discussion.That is why the bhikshunis who fully understand the process would prefer to go through monks for precept transmission.It is as per our Vinaya that the precept substance can only be conferred by going through the proper protocol.
