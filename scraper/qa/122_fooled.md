# Fooled

​Question:Greetings!!!​I am 21 years old and I am confused. These days, I feel that the Buddha’s way places are the only safe places for me. I am not sure what kinds of tests I must undergo this lifetime, but many times people make a fool out of me. Even the people from overseas also target me.       I am so frustrated and hurt that I am at the point of being unable to trust anyone. I am skeptical of everything. I am cautious of everyone.​I feel that life’s challenges are just too overwhelming. It seems like everyone is against me. Please tell me what to do. I am anxiously waiting for your response.  Answer:Just because people hurt you does not mean that you cannot forgive them.You should learn to let go of the hurt and ignore the scars. From the Buddhist way of looking at things, maybe you owe them, and that is why they can cheat you. If you don’t really owe them, there is nothing they can do to you. Therefore, you might as well pay up your past karmic debts willingly because you have no choice anyway.There is a saying: “Fool me once: shame on you! Fool me twice: shame on me!” Learn from the experience until you are no longer taken.The strong never becomes bitter and resentful.​The wise can easily forgive.
