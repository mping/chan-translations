# Repenting for the Deviant Sex Precept

Question:Ven. Master,I am a Buddhist disciple. I received the Five Precepts a long time ago. Because I did not know how to follow the Precepts properly, I violated the Deviant Sex precept. ​Since I realized my mistake, I felt very repentant and worried. Please compassionately rescue me. I am residing in Chicago and I would come to your temple to meet with you if you allow me. I am very grateful for your consideration.​BJ      Answer:To be able to keep Precepts will generate countless blessings. However, if you violate the “unrepentable portions” then there will be very serious consequences. Furthermore, if you have violated the Deviant Sex precept then you most likely have violated the other Precepts as well.You should bow to the Buddha 10,000 bows. Then you should contact the temple to make an appointment to see me.We will help you conduct a repentance Dharma in order to eradicate the retributions, and purify the body and mind so that you can start anew. Then we will teach you how to keep Precepts in order to avoid similar failures in the future.​Emituofo!
