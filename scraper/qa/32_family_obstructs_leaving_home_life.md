# Family Obstructs Leaving Home Life

Question:Ven. Master,I wish to leave the home life but my family is putting up a lot of roadblocks. I can’t seem to find a way out. Please teach me what to do. Thank you.​MJ      Answer:To leave the home life requires a lot more blessings than people realize. Think about it: You sit there and really do “nothing” and yet people come and cook and clean for you, offer incense, money, and so forth. Clearly, that must be due to accruing blessings beforehand.​Therefore, you should come to the temple and generate a lot of blessings to accomplish your goal: volunteer your time there, make offerings, learn to meditate, bow repentances, etc.Your family’s obstructions are also a test of your sincerity. Once you have enough blessings, you can overcome their objections.
