# Buddha Pedant

Question:Venerable Master,​Can I ask you a little question? People say if we wear a Buddha pendant and leave it on while changing our clothes, we would be committing offenses. Is that right?      ﻿Answer:Oh dear!​Can you cover up the Buddha’s eyes when changing clothes?  Question: (follow-up)​How can I cover up the Buddha’s eyes?  Answer:It’s rather difficult to explain. Actually, there’s no problem. The Buddha does not mind at all. Whether you wear clothes or not, it’s all the same to the Buddha.​However, traditionally it’s a good idea to remove the pendant before entering impure places like bathrooms, etc. out of respect. But remember to put it on again lest you lose the pendant.
