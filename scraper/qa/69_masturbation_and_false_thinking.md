# Masturbation & False Thinking

Question:Ven. Master,I have two questions:1. If a lay Buddhist disciple masturbates, is that a Precept violation? Is that repentable? Is masturbation a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept?​2. When I recite sutras, I still have a lot of false-thinking and that makes me very afflicted. Am I creating offenses because I cannot control my thoughts?Please kindly instruct me so that I can better understand Precepts.​Emituofo,JK      Answer:1. If you have not yet received the Precepts then you have not violated them. However, that being said, you still violate the “Precepts against nature,” meaning that it’s not a good thing. In the strict sense, masturbation is not a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept, but it is a violation of your inherent wisdom. Knowing that, shouldn’t you work harder at putting an end to ignorant behavior?​2. We all do. That is why we come to the temple to learn how to eliminate false-thinking. Yes, you are creating mind offenses. But you are also generating merit and virtue if you keep at it. After you learn the proper methodology, you will eventually be able to eliminate your errant thoughts and realize Non-thought.
