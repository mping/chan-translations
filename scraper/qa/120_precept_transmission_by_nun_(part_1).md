# Precept Transmission By Nun (part 1)

Question:Ven. Master,I have often seen many senior monks allow men and women to leave the home life. However, can nuns allow men to leave the home life? Is that against the Vinaya? Where can I find this document?Thank you for your instruction.Emituofo,​J      Answer:In general, bhikshunis are not allowed to transmit precepts to their disciples by themselves. Under normal conditions, they usually ask their male counterpart to fulfill this responsibility. Those bhikshunis who choose to transmit the precepts without the help of a monk are doing their disciples a great disservice because bhikshunis do not have the authority to do this. Their disciples are not receiving the precept substance and as a result, they will face great difficulties in their practice.​Finally, only left home people are allowed to read and consult the Precepts manuals. Even if you have access to them, please do not read them because you would be creating offenses.
