# Fur Farming

Question:A friend emailed me this article exposing the fur farming industry. Although I would never buy fur, reading this just makes me wonder how the Karmic debts would work out in this case. Will the spirits of the killed animals become hungry ghosts who attack the immediate killer of them or the factory owners or the buyer of the fur coat or all the above in certain amounts. Also is there anything that we can do on our end to lessen the suffering of those unappeased spirits (chanting and dedicating the blessings to them). Thanks for any input.Article: Chinese Fur Farms​JC, San Mateo, California       Answer:Kill and you’ll be killed.Take life and you owe a debt of blood. The victim will not be satisfied until you pay for their sufferings.This karmic debt is stored in our 8th consciousness until it is resolved.​This is why there are mortal enemies, e.g. in the human realm such as suicide bombers. On the surface, these people may seem to be motivated by some so-called heavenly rewards (such as heavenly maidens), but at a deeper level, there is a blood debt settlement between these groups of people.
