# Homosexuality & Sex Precept

Question:Ven. Master:​Is homosexuality a violation of the deviant sex precept? If so, what are the consequences if one is determined to follow the Buddha’s teachings?      Answer:Allow me to make a clarification about this sensitive issue.Personally, I have no problem. I do not pass judgment on others. I live and let live. The law of cause and effect, as described by the Buddha, will determine the consequences of our actions.As far as the Buddhist precepts are concerned, yes, homosexuality violates the non-deviant sex precept. It also violates the laws of nature: the natural yin and yang if you will, whether or not one believes in the Buddha’s teachings.The consequences vary with the degrees of violation. On the other hand, one can perform Buddhist repentances to lessen the degrees of severity.​The good news is that if one really likes to do something about it, one can cultivate according to Buddhist practices to eliminate the problem. More specifically, if one can build one’s samadhi power to higher levels, then sexual desire will eventually wane until it disappears naturally.
