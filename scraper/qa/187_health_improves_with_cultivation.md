# Health Improves With Cultivation

Question: Dear Dharma Master,First off, I hope you are fine and all is well. Though we haven’t been talking about it, I’m up to just over two hour-long meditation sessions per day. Without your influence, nothing remotely like that would have come about, so please accept my appreciation for your instruction. I am looking to do more in future.​TB, Van Nuys, California       Answer: Thank you for sharing with us your positive experience from our combined Chan (meditation) and Pure Land (recite the Buddha’s name) practice.As I indicated to you earlier, you came in at First Dhyana and may I say, in pretty physical shape. After one year of practice, you’ve reached Fourth Dhyana and basically your health improved 100%. I’m impressed with your steadfastness especially since you have to drive 45 minutes each way to come to us on both Saturdays and Sundays.Keep up the good work.​Let’s keep on improving your kung fu (and thus your rebirth grade) before we send you off for rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land to practice with Amitabha Buddha.
