# Obtain rebirth through reciting Buddha name

Question:Ven. Master:I find it hard to believe that by merely reciting the Buddha’s name, I could obtain rebirth to the Pure Land. My brother said that the Sutras were altered, and that videos about rebirth used professional actors.​TT      Answer:I do not blame you for being skeptical. I would be too regarding the authenticity of your sources.Personally, I believe it because my teacher, the late Great Master Xuan Hua said so. He would not lie to me nor has he ever lied to anyone about Buddhism.Furthermore, I consult the original Buddhist Scriptures known as the Great Treasury Scriptures 大藏經. They are recognized by all Buddhist experts as the indisputable teachings of the Buddha.​After you have planted more blessings with Mahayana, you too will believe.
