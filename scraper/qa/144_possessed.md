# Possessed

Question:I hear that within a buffer zone of a few hundred meters, the ghosts and spirits cannot encroach. Why is that in a number of Vietnamese temples, there are Buddhist disciples or left home people who are possessed by yin beings, rendering intelligible when speaking, or sometimes they enter spasms… How can these situations addressed?​N      Answer:Not necessarily all Way places are like that. Usually Way places are protected when there are cultivators present.​Furthermore, yin beings are allowed to enter our temple if they obey the rules and behave themselves. It’s too complicated to cursively explain how to address these types of possession problems. Should there be specific problems for specific individuals, then you should personally come to a Good Knowing Adviser for instructions.
