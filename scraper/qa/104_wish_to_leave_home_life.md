# Wish to leave home life

Question:Emituofo. I am very honored to know you. Do you accept female left-home disciples who really wish to cultivate?Amituofo​AN      Answer:Thank you for your inquiry.I have accepted and am training female left-home disciples. They are required to live in the temple for one year to build their blessings. Then they must go through a special two-year novice training program before they are considered for ordination. This applies to men as well since we do not discriminate based genders, ethnicities or ages.​Since we are a small temple, we concentrate on investing our limited resources on training only those who have demonstrated their utmost sincerity in leaving the home life. The reason for leaving the home life is to receive in-depth training and build the proper foundation to obtain liberation or rebirth to the Pure Land.
