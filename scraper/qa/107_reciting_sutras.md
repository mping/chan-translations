# Reciting Sutras

Question:Can I recite sutras when I have some free time?When I recite sutras, I do not know how to hit the wood fish; is that still OK?If I wish to have a child, which sutra should I recite?Thank you.​H      Answer:You certainly should recite sutras when you have some free time. To get the most out of your recitation, when you recite sutras, make sure you are free: drop everything and concentrate on the recitation.It is not necessary to strike the woodfish when reciting sutras. Generally, the woodfish is used in order to help the assembly recite at the same pace; it is not necessary when reciting by yourself.​To assist you in having a child, I recommend that you sincerely and regularly recite the Universal Door Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra. I understand that disciples who have regularly recited this section of the Lotus Sutra have received help for this very request. For example, one of Master XuanHua’s disciples told me that she had tried everything with no success. Then she recited this chapter every day for three years. She also sincerely bowed to the GuanYin Bodhisattva. Miraculously, she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy.
