# Vegetarian in gratitude

Question:I am a high school student. I often pray that if I pass my test, then I’d eat vegetarian in order to show my gratitude. Everything I pray for all came through. Should I follow through with eating vegetarian?​TTĐ       Answer:Congratulations in obtaining your wishes.First of all, in the Buddhist way of looking at things, if you made a promise, then you must keep it. If you don’t, they (meaning the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas) probably won’t take anything away from you, but don’t expect much help the next time around.​Furthermore, eating vegetarian is very healthy and compassionate. We’re showing our respect for living beings when we don’t eat them. Try it for a while and find out for yourself. Initially, you’ll have to face your friends and family’s objections and concerns: they’ll say that you aren’t getting enough protein, or you just want to draw attention to yourself, etc. Of course, almost all of their objections are wrong . I’d like to suggest that you read up on the topic and talk to as many people as you can find who have been vegetarian for a long time.Finally, I hope that the responses you received will convince you to lead a virtuous and decent life. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas always protect and help those who are good.
