# 15 minutes Lunch part 2

Question:Ven. Master,阿彌陀佛. Thank you very much for your reply. I’m sorry I forgot to mention that when I visited Po Lin Monastery they were indeed having their very long Chan Qi which lasted for 70 days (ten weeks), though not everyone there participated. ​I don’t know whether they eat so quickly at other times, but since you said there is no need to train for it I’ll just leave this matter aside. I think what you said about US people being “more self-indulgent and impatient” is very very true. As I was used to the American city life, it took me a lot of efforts to learn the rules and conventions of Hong Kong Buddhist temples/centers (and I’m still learning them). I feel that this helps me grow in maturity.Bows in Respect,​MH      Answer:You are very perceptive and seem to have great affinity with Chan.The Chan Qi is one of the most wonderful Dharma Doors in Mahayana. It is a shame that Pao Lin is no longer doing 100-day Chan Qis. Maybe we’ll have to restore this wonderful Dharma in the US in order to help people become enlightened quicker.You should use the opportunity to train by taking part in their Chan Qis. Come for a day or day on the weekend. Gradually increase the number of days.After you can do three or four full days, you should consider coming to Lu Mountain temple to participate in our Chan Qis for seven days. You’ll make a lot of progress.​Bliss in the Dharma.
