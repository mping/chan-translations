# Practicing Immortality Dharma

Question:Emituofo:Do you know anything about immortality dharmas?Can Buddhist disciples practice such dharmas? Would such practices have detrimental effects on our Buddhist practices?Please kindly teach me.Thank you.​PVT      Answer:I too was drawn to some immortality practices because they claim to have such wonderful results. Now, as I look back, I realize that some of such practices are quite effective. I also felt very lucky that I chose to practice the Buddhist Dharmas instead of theirs.You should not practice such dharmas for two major reasons:​When you took refuge with the Triple Jewel, you made the vow not to draw near “externalist dharmas”. This is not because the Triple Jewel feels threatened by them. It is only because their dharmas are not ultimate: they will not help you attain liberation.I believe that the Buddhist Dharmas are so much more effective than theirs. For example, you can get far greater results more quickly if you practice Chan under a Good Knowing Adviser.
