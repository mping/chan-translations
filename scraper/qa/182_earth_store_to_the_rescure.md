# Earth Store to the Rescure

Question:​Dear Dharma Master,I just completed 7 days of reciting Earth Store Bodhisattva’s name today. Tomorrow I will start on the Sutra Recitation. (I have a recitation copy). I’m doing that last as I know I’ll lose my voice.I did SEEM to have a response after 47,000 recitations, but it was so subtle it could have been my mind playing tricks. If it was real, Dennis [Hopper] has already gone where ever Earth Store wants to take him. If not, my continued efforts might be of some use. Anyway, I will do what I can.Regards,​TB, Van Nuys, California      Answer:​To recite is to obtain responses.If you really believe so, stop looking for signs of a response. If it’s the right thing to do, then do it without any expectations, that is true kindness.​I commend your making an effort to lend a helping hand to someone in his hour of need. I assure you that he greatly appreciates it. In my humble opinion, that’s what brings meanings to life.
