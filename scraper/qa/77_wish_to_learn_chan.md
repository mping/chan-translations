# Wish To Learn Chan

Question:[A Buddhist disciple who is 63 years old asks:]I have been meditating for several years with little result… Thanks to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, I was able to get a hold of your book, “The Chan Handbook: The Learner’s Guide to Meditation.” ​​After reading it, I realized that you are a competent and kind Good Knowing Adviser. That is why I wish to learn meditation from you. I live quite far away, in Illinois. Please kindly tell me when you will hold your meditation retreats, the location and duration. Also, how can I get in touch with you?Thank you very much.​TA      Answer:Thank you for inquiry. I am not worthy of your praise. My late Chan teacher, Great Master Xuan Hua had many very competent disciples who understand Chan as well. I waited and waited for them to write a book on Chan so that I can use it to train my students. Eventually I decided to write it myself because I could no longer wait.​I’ll ask one of my students to get in touch with you to discuss how we can help speed up your meditation progress. That way, we can make up for the lost years if you are willing to work hard.
