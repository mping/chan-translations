# Hands and Eyes Transmission

Question:Na Mo Fundamental Teacher Shakyamuni Buddha,My respects to the sangha!Please advise me as to how I can learn about the 42 Hands & Eyes.I would appreciate an email answer.Emituofo,​TTH      Answer:One must receive transmission for this particular type of Tantric Dharma before it can be practiced. For example, I received transmission but I am not authorized to transmit it. I do know of some people who are authorized to transmit it but I am not authorized to tell you who they are.However, you can create affinity with this Dharma by memorizing the Great Compassion Mantra and reciting it daily. Or you can make offerings to Guan Yin Bodhisattva, by sincerely bowing to it daily.​Once you have enough blessings, then you will receive transmission.
