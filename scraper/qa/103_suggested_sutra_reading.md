# Suggested Sutra Reading

Question:Venerable Master,​I do not know much about Buddhism; however my teachers did talk about Buddhist principles when I was in school. They elaborated on some topics such as merit and virtue, and reincarnation…      May ask you this question: If I wish to read sutras in order to increase my blessings, which sutra should I start with?Also, my teachers said that by increasing one’s blessings, one can actually change one’s destiny, is that correct? Thank you very much!​DA  Answer:In my humble opinion, all sutras are equally beneficial in generating blessings. You can start with any sutra that you want. I recommend that you concentrate on the Mahayana sutras, which are translated from Sanskrit, because they generate more blessings than any other type of Buddhist sutra.More importantly, you want to focus on the credible authors. For example, I highly recommend that you read all the books from my late teacher and Patriarch, Great Master Xuan Hua. You should stick to the writings by the Buddhist patriarchs because they give you the proper views and knowledge.​Yes, if one accrues the right kind of blessings, one can alter one’s own fate.
