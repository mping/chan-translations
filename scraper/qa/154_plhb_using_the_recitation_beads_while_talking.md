# [PLHB] Using the recitation beads while talking

Question:​I use the recitation beads and recite the Buddha’s name while talking or listening the the Dharma. Is that appropriate?       Answer:Using the recitation beads is a very good way to remind oneself to recite the Buddha’s name.However, you should not imitate others in using the recitation beads like a monkey.The actual method is to concentrate, each time you recite the Buddha’s name, that is when you push one bead. The objective is to make it become automatic: you push one bead corresponds to your reciting the Buddha’s name once. It should not be the case that your hand pushes a bead but your mind does not recite the Buddha’s name.If such is your skill level, then it is OK to use the bead while talking, walking, or listening to the Dharma as long as each bead results in one recitation.Personally, I prefer not to use the beads because it tells the whole world that I am reciting the Buddha’s name. I prefer not to draw attention to myself.​I prefer to cultivate discreetly without advertising it. To cultivate means that we do what others are doing: we can blend in.
