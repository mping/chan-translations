# Too Much False Thinking

Question:Emituofo;I wish you good health and much bliss.I used to be Christian until a good knowing adviser suggested that I try Buddhism.My life is full of upheavals but I feel that Pure Land Buddhism is very conceivable and very beneficial.I feel like leaving the home life but people would talk me out of it and inside my mind is full of hesitation, perhaps because I still have a lot of karmic debts.When I participated in a Guan Yin recitation week, I would feel compelled to leave and go home.What should I do?Thank you very much.​                      QD      Answer:You found the right path but should seek a better guide.In order to get a great Good Knowing Adviser, you need to plant a lot of blessings just like one must pay more for a better degree from a superior university.​Therefore if I were you, I would concentrate on going to a Mahayana temple to do volunteer work and to make offerings to plant these blessings. In time, because of your sincere effort, you will come across an appropriate Good Knowing Adviser who will be able to guide you. Give it a few years before you again participate in those Dharma Assemblies.
