# Neglecting Husband

Question:Emituofo.We already have two children but my husband still prefers to spend time with his friends, drinking among other things. I want to convince my husband to walk the Buddha path with me but am not sure what I should do. ​I often recite the Buddha’s name and repent, hoping that my husband will quickly change his ways. I also pray that the Buddha will awaken my husband: but is it too greedy of my part?Please kindly instruct me.PSD        Answer:You may want to take advantage of your husband outside interests to come to the temple and learn how to cultivate. Save yourself first instead of trying to save or change him. If you can’t save yourself, you certainly cannot have any really significant influence on him.​The Buddha cannot save your husband. He has to help himself. One cannot attain liberation unless one cultivates. Even the Buddha cannot cultivate for any of us.
