# Singleminded Recitation

Question:Greetings Ven. Master,I practice Reciting the Buddha’s name.Why do you advocate Chan and Pure Land Joint Cultivation? Would that not be difficult to become single-minded?Emituofo,​TH      ​Answer:​Good for you!Several years ago, I started with teaching Chan in my living room. Then a few years later, I decided to teach Chan and Pure Land Joint Cultivation for these reasons:I realized that most Chan students will not make it through the Chan Dharma Door this lifetime. Therefore I urged them to practice reciting the Buddha’s name as an insurance policy.Also, most people who recite the Buddha’s name do not know how to attain the Buddha Recitation Samadhi. Their cultivation approach will not bring them to single-mindedness. That was why I urged them to train in our Mahayana Chan methodology as well.If you feel confident that you can attain single-mindedness through the Buddha Recitation method, stick to it.However, will you consider this suggestion?​The fact that you even asked me, showed that you do not know how to attain single-mindedness yet. Those who do know would never consider asking me.
