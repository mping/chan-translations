# Rebellious Daughter

Question:Ven. Master,I feel miserable because my daughter will not listen to me even though she is only in the sixth grade. She is twelve years old. What am I to do?Emituofo,​Buddhist disciple TH      Answer:I see two problems:Children often learn from their mistakes. Instead of getting afflicted from her being rebellious, you should instead resign yourself to telling her in advance that she is headed toward trouble and that her actions will have the opposite effect that she is wishing. If you are correct, then she will be more inclined to believe you in the future. Remember, you should be cool-headed instead of getting afflicted when she does not listen to you. It does not hurt to find out who she has faith in or respects and ask that person for help.​Furthermore, perhaps you are getting afflicted because you are afraid that you cannot handle it when she really gets into trouble. That’s the retribution for all parents. You could go the spiritual route and create blessings for her so that she will not get into trouble. Furthermore, resolve to be a role model of virtue for her by becoming more pious. You are responsible for instilling virtues in her. Therefore, you should become more virtuous! If you are sincere in this approach, she will be impressed by your actions and then she will naturally follow suit.
