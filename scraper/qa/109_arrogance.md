# Arrogance

Question:What is arrogance like?​NVD      Answer:For example, one asks questions with the attitude that there is no need for proper etiquette; perhaps because one feels so important that he or she is entitled to have one’s queries replied to regardless of how disrespectful or inconsiderate one is.​I feel unqualified to provide an answer to this question.
