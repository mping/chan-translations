# Periods

Question:Ven. Master:May I ask a rather delicate question that has been bothering me for quite a while? Please kindly clarify it for me. Emituofo.Master, when a woman is having her period, is appropriate for her to go to the temple? Either way, what is she supposed to pay attention to? Thank you and wishing you much accomplishment​LX      Answer:The older generation seems to discourage women from going to the temple when they have their period.That is illogical because when the Buddha was in the world, he had a lot of female left home disciples and there seemed to be no restrictions on their activities when they had their periods. We have no such restrictions at our temple because that would hinder their cultivation.​I feel that the more opportunities you have to come to the temple, the better off you will be: There is no need for any such restriction.
