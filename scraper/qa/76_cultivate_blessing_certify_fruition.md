# Cultivate Blessing Certify Fruition

Question:Can one certify to the sagely fruitions by cultivating blessings only and not practice meditation? Please kindly and compassionately teach us.​QD      Answer:Of course, to cultivate is to eventually certify, as a general rule of thumb.​While each case differs, it is important to understand that practicing meditation will speed up certifying to the sagely fruitions more so than cultivating blessings alone.
