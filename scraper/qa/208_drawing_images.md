# Drawing Images

Question:​I have questions regarding drawing imaging of Earth Store Bodhisattva.Quote from chapter 6, page 37 of the sutra“Universally Expansive, if good men or good women gaze upon and bow but once to painted or drawn images of the Bodhisattva or ones made of clay, or stone, or lacquer, or gold, or silver, or bronze, they will be reborn one hundred times in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and will eternally avoid falling into the evil paths.”1. If we draw it with computer programs does that count?​2. What if we delete the files after we drew the picture? Does that count? Is that consider making offense?       Answer:​1. Yes it does.​2. While designing the image, those files do not count. However, upon completion of your design work, those files are “images” of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. They should be treated as such. Why would you want to delete them? In fact, you could “move” them to our web site so that they can be shared.
