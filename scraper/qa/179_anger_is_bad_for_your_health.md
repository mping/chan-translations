# Anger is bad for your Health

Question:The last six months I have experienced occasional non exertional chest pain (similar to heart attack). So far all the Western medicine tests came back negative.Please advise to what I should do.Thank you​HN, Long Beach, CA       Answer: ​People with samadhi power like you must learn to make adjustments.To have samadhi power forces you to be more careful about the tendency for aggression to protect our turf.For example, when you direct your anger or aggression toward someone or some animal, they are in big trouble. Simultaneously, your body takes a beating from your temper and aggression.More specifically, when you get angry, your heart and liver take a beating. Not surprisingly, nowadays it’s not uncommon for people to have heart and liver problems as they get older since they get angry quite often.Learn to cool off as soon as you feel the heat or anger or aggression arise internally. Instead, bring forth the mind of kindness and compassion: not many people can withstand your anger or aggression. Learn to see through it and put it down. Learn not to contend. Your husband is better than you in this area. He seems to be a lot more at peace than you.Adopt a more yielding and harmonious attitude. It’ll make life so much more pleasant for all those around you whether at work or at home.​While this may require some time to take root, go see our temple’s unofficial doctor. He’ll teach you some exercises to alleviate the symptoms.
