# Chan Class

Question:Ven. Master,​I wish to learn meditation under your guidance and therefore plan to participate in the Chan class that starts July 14, 2012 [at your Rosemead temple]. However, I live in San Diego and would have a hard time coming to the temple every Saturday.      I did learn the basics of meditation through late Master Hằng Hiển [the previous head monk of her temple]. He taught me to sit in full lotus and use the breath counting technique.Is it possible for me to attend a few of your Saturday sessions to learn and then practice at home?Thank you very much.​TNQ  Answer:Thank you for your inquiry.Yes you certainly may and should.We will be teaching the secret techniques of the Chan patriarchs at our meditation class; we would certainly be glad to teach you as much as you can absorb.​In the future, if there is interest, we would consider organizing a one-day Chan class at your local temple too.
