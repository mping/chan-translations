# Repenting for Deviant Sex Precept

Question:Ven. Master,If I have sex with the person I love, is it a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept? If so, how do I repent for it? Please kindly instruct me.Emituofo,​HP      Answer:Yes it is a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept if you have already received the Five Precepts.It is very difficult to repent but it can be done. I am not at liberty to discuss it publicly; otherwise I would be breaking Precepts myself. Also, you cannot “retake” the Deviant Sex Precept until after your offenses have been erased.​Generally speaking, I hope that left-home people would properly train their disciples on the Precepts, their meaning and responsibilities, before transmitting the Precepts to them. I was also not trained when I received them from my Chinese teacher and simply “lucked-out,” because somehow, I avoided committing violations before I thoroughly understood the responsibilities of receiving them. Perhaps if you would also ask these questions of the left-home people at your temple, they will come to realize that they need further training to help you.
