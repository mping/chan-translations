# Mystic Universe

Question:There is a Tibetan sect called Mystic Universe. Are they in line with Mahayana teachings? Should I join them?Please spend time to look into it and tell me what you think of them.​Amituofo      Answer:My late master, Ven. Xuan Hua always emphasized to us that in order to teach Westerners, we’ll have to teach about morality. True to his teachings, his disciples emphasize goodness and decency, although they have tremendous skills and powers through tantras, even more so that most specialists in Tantric Schools. Why? It’s because Tantric practices are not meant to be known, let alone advertised as “Mystic”, special powers or special knowledge.I too agree with my master. Mahayana is about knowing how to resolve your daily problems with goodness and morality.​I would not take seriously people who advertise special abilities and mysticism.
