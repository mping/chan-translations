# Oregon Assembly

Question:Dear Master,I have been planning to go to the one week retreat in Oregon with Master Heng Sure starting end of the month, and also combine that with a week or two at CTTB. Though recent spells of low energy and low motivation sometimes make me feel like not going, I do tend to think it would be a good thing to attend. I was wondering, do you have any opinion whether this would be a good retreat for me to go to?Also, It seems the Medicine Master Buddha Plaque has been of some help for M [my girlfriend] already, as she has been hired to teach one course at CSULB again. Thanks to you, and of course to Medicine Master Buddha, for your support!​Emituofo,TM, LB, California      Answer:The tradition of the serious Mahayana cultivator is to shore up his spirit, be prepared to go the distance and endure great hardship to draw near a good knowing adviser.Master Heng Sure is one such teacher worth making the effort to learn from.​Do not pass up on such an opportunity.
