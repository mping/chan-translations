# Tailgate Karma

Question:​I have a friend who I have warned not to tailgate for quite some time. I advised him that by doing so karma will come back. Last Friday it seems that it did. Since he usually tailgates people even on the highway to the point that he is less than 1 car length away from the car in front of him. I warned him that he will make the person in front nervous and feel agitated. Anyway last Friday karma seems to have taught him a lesson.      He was approaching an intersection and the cars in front of him were slow and guess what happened from behind, somebody who was tailgating him hit him. He got whiplash from the incident. I had to take him to the hospital. It took more than 3 hrs to examine him since they put him in a room and forgot about him. He also went to work that Sat against the Doctors advise and made his whiplash worse. But now it is getting better after I told him to slow it down and not tailgate so much. Very interesting case. Since karmic retribution is very accurate. I was shocked that it can be this accurate.​JC, San Mateo, California   Answer:​Thank you for sharing the story.We hope that your friend gets it: one gets what one sows. You are quite right: the law of cause & effect is never off even by a hair.​In the long run, he needs to pay attention to his tendency for aggression. It makes him a rather unpleasant fellow to have around.
