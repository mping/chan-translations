# I Have Had Abortions

Question:Master YongHua:I have had a few abortions in the past.Now that I believe in Buddhism which advocates non-killing, I realize that such actions were unwise and cruel to say the least.What can I do to make amends for my erroneous ways?​Anonymous      Answer:Dear Anonymous:Thank you for having the courage to ask this heartbreaking question.Your predicament is shared by quite a few women of the world.I empathize with the pain and anguish that you experienced. It is not uncommon that such decisions were made under desperate conditions.Aborted children generally fall into the ghost realms. They are angry at their mothers while at the same time they cannot let go of their love for them. That is why they stay in close proximity and often cause problems for their mothers in the form of frequent headaches or disturbances during sleep or severe depression. This is what some of my disciples who have had abortions have reported to me.I will give you the same advice that I gave them:Please request rebirth plaques for your aborted children at a competent Mahayana Buddhist temple.Our experience indicates that in time the aborted children will eventually have enough blessings to be liberated from their suffering and will be reborn to the Western Bliss Pure Land. Once there they will no longer suffer and they will be grateful to you. If they receive competent assistance, they will rapidly get relief for their misery and as a result, they will stop harassing you.My best wishes!​Emituofo!
