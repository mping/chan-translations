# Daily 30 minutes increments

Question:Good day! To get to the point, I sat in full lotus for 30 minutes three days ago, then one hour the next day.I was going for 1.5 hours the next day, yesterday, but in 20 or so minutes the knee pain became worse than it had ever been previously and I stopped by about 30 minutes. What should I do? Should I just keep forcing it and endure?​Best wishes, Paul      Answer:Kudos to you for your toughness!For the average person, we would recommend that they go for no more than one hour increment maximum per week. This way it will allow the body to recover and adjust to new heights. And it is very important to walk for at least half an hour a day. To go for long sits too fast could cause hyperextension of the knees.Some types of pain are acceptable and should be endured, some are not.Overall, do not try to force it. We all can only go as fast as our blessings enable us.As you have discovered you ran into your own limitations and need guidance. If you wish, please give us a call so that we can get to know your personal situation. We will also be able to give you advice that is tailored to your needs.
