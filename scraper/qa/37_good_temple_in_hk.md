# Good Temple in HK

Question:Ven. Master,I’m a beginning Buddhist practitioner, and I heard about you through a fellow practitioner during a short visit to City of 10,000 Buddhas this past July. I bought your book and liked it very much (I find your advice of not using a cushion when meditating especially helpful).Unfortunately I don’t have enough blessings to meet with you in person, as I just moved to Hong Kong from the US. When I was reading your Q&A session, I was very excited to see that you mentioned you had visited quite competent temples in Hong Kong. Could you please recommend to me some good temples in Hong Kong? I hope eventually to be able to find a GKA to guide me.Thank you very much and I wish you a great Thanksgiving.Bows in Respect,​M​        ​Answer:I am very glad that you enjoy your meditation practice. The more skilled you become, the more benefits you will get out of meditation.Our Chan Handbook provides the basic Chan techniques that I learned primarily from my late teacher, Great Master Xuan Hua, who is a Patriarch of the Gui Yang lineage.You could also learn from the late Great Master Sheng Yi who is also a Gui Yang Patriarch. His disciples are good meditation practitioners who are not after fame and profit.You could look them up as follows:聖一法師道場寶林禪寺 大嶼山東涌地塘仔 2988 1532​Peace and bliss in the Dharma.
