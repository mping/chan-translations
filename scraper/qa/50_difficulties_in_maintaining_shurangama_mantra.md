# Difficulties in maintaining Shurangama Mantra

Question:Emituofo,I would really appreciate your kind guidance.I realize that I have a lot of greedy desires and therefore I resolved to recite the Shurangama Mantra [not clear…]. ​​However, after each time that I recite the Mantra I often have unwholesome thoughts whereas when I do not recite the Mantra, my mind would be normal: not that it is free from greedy desires but rather it is not as heavy and uncomfortable as when I recite.Please teach me what to do. Thank you.​HD      ​Answer:You have great blessings for having the ability to maintain the Shurangama Mantra.What you are experiencing is called karmic obstructions.The Vietnamese have a saying: “The ten thousand undertakings are very hard to kick-start.” It takes time and patience before you can get your momentum.​Just patiently endure the discomfort. Keep at it and it won’t be long before the discomfort abates and the bliss increases. It will be worth it if you resolve to endure the difficult start because you will gain inconceivable benefits with the practice.
