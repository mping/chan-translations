# Quelling Natural Disasters

Question: Is there any appropriate plaque or ceremony we can do for Taiwan?​AT, Cerritos, California       Answer: Good indeed! Good indeed! Your compassionate mind is manifesting itself.From a causal perspective, we cultivators are to blame for these natural disasters because of our lack of virtues. It is said that true cultivators can create a perimeter of security around the area where they cultivate. For example, when Great Master Xuan Hua (of the CTTB) was in San Francisco, there was no earthquake or natural disaster.Traditionally, in order to appease the gods, spirits and ghosts who are bent on destruction and inflicting pain and sufferings, people would set up an altar in the afflicted area and then ask virtuous sanghans to conduct quelling disasters ceremonies. Making such offerings to the Triple Jewel seemed to soothe their anger and provided much needed relief. Historically speaking, this kind of intervention has ended natural disasters such as severe drought, epidemics, flooding, etc.​At a smaller scale, locally, we could try doing up to three intervention (special) ceremonies, say in three consecutive weeks.
