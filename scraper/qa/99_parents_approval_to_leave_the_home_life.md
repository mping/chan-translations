# Parents’ Approval To Leave The Home Life

Question:Dear Venerable Master,How do I help my parents to allow me to leave the home life?​TT      Answer:Parents want their children to be happy. If your parents believe that you’ll be happier as a left home person, then they will agree to make this major sacrifice and will not obstruct you.Start slowly!First take the time to find the right Good Knowing Adviser (GKA) for you. He or she must have the spiritual skills and blessings to be able to teach you. Through your GKA’s guidance, you will draw closer to the Triple Jewel and as a result, you will become a much happier person. I would like to suggest that you attend extended cultivation programs such as The Buddha Recitation Week or Chan Week.If you already have a Good Knowing Adviser please discuss this with him or her. Your GKA should be able to determine whether or not becoming a nun is appropriate for you. Then he or she would know how to help you pave the way for your parents’ acceptance.
