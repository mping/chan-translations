# Are you Enlightened?

Question:I’d like to know whether or not you monks are enlightened yet or have been liberated and free from suffering or the wheel of reincarnation?If one does not know the way does it make sense to guide others?​S      ​Answer:Whether we are enlightened or not is not a topic for public discussion. It is a private matter between our teachers and ourselves. For you to even think of asking reflects your lack of understanding, your lack of respect for Buddhism, and a certain level of arrogance.​I teach because my teacher told me to do so. It seems to make sense to my students. Your question seems to also imply that they (both my teacher and students) are so stupid that they cannot tell right from wrong or black from white, which actually proves that you are the one who is ignorant.
