# Wife Wants Oral Sex

Question:Ven. Masters,I married a woman who seems to be of the world: she seems to enjoy oral sex. I have yet to give her my consent but she has dropped hints that she would definitely get satisfaction elsewhere if she is left unsatisfied. ​May I ask: Is it OK to have oral sex with one’s wife? The reason I ask is because we already have children and to divorce would not be good karma either.​NVC      Answer:Having oral sex with one’s spouse is not an offense.However, I fear that your marriage will not last if she insists on getting [“more”] satisfaction. Why? With such an attitude, she will most likely seek [“more”] satisfaction whether or not you cooperate. Having such a strong attachment to sexual gratification will make it hard not to experiment with other partners.​I hope it works out for you.
