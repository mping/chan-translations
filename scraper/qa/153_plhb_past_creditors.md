# [PLHB] Past creditors

Question:Are our external wounds the result of past karmic retributions?​Each time I focus on reciting the Buddha’s name, many obstructions would arise. Someone suggested that I should accord with conditions and dedicate the merit and virtue to the Past Creditors. How I can succeed in my practice?      Answer:That’s correct, getting wounded is the result of retributions from past karmas.When we recite the Buddha’s name or cultivate in general, there will be obstructions and difficulties. They can be classified as:1. Karmic obstructions: For example, lifting a heavy object is not easy.2. Retribution obstructions: Such as we obstructed others in the past. How we undergo the retribution of being obstructed. This belongs to the “Past Creditors” category.3. Affliction obstructions: Although the obstruction is not significant but we get afflicted and give up.I am not clear on “according with conditions”. The advice is a bit fuzzy to me. You should clarify it with the adviser.When you encounter obstructions while cultivating, you should learn to endure patiently. Why are you complaining? Without obstructions, how can you make progress? It’s just like at school, can you obtain a degree without taking tests?​If you meet with a GKA then you’ll be directed on how to resolve your obstructions in order to bring you to your end goal. Each obstruction must resolved according to its specificity. It cannot be generalized.
