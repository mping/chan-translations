# Renouncing Deviant Sex Precept

Ven. Master,I am a Buddhist disciple who also received the Five Precepts. Unfortunately, I have not been able to keep the Non-deviant Sex precept. ​​I simply cannot control my urges and frequently have sexual relations with others. Both sides seek sexual gratification, not love. I am still single. ​      At numerous times, I knelt in front of the Buddhas to repent and promised to no longer violate the Non-deviant Sex Precept but I would only break my resolve later. I am very ashamed of myself and realize that my offenses are quite serious.I was not taught about the Five Precepts properly that is why I received all five Precepts. I never realized that I would have such a hard time keeping the Deviant Sex Precept.Can I renounce this Sex Precept? Is there a proper procedure for it? I wish to renounce the precept in order to avoid creating offenses against the nature in the event that I cannot resist my urges.Emituofo,​DC  Answer:Your predicament is quite commonplace because of the lack of proper training from the religious teachers.We typically do not give Precepts instructions on the internet but in the interest of helping honest people like yourself, we will tell you how to renounce the Non-deviant Sex Precept.Just tell anyone who can understand you the following three times:​“I, (say your name), hereby renounce the Non-Deviant Sex Precept of the Buddha’s.”
