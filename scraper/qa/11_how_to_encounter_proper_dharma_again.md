# How to Encounter Proper Dharma Again

Question:Ven. Master:The fact that I have encountered your Dharma and Great Master Xuan Hua’s is probably from prior conditions, is that correct? If I fail to get reborn to the Western Bliss Pure Land this lifetime, how do I make sure that I will be able to encounter again the Buddhadharma?Please compassionately clarify the above for me.​MTV      Answer:That is correct. You must have had a lot of blessings with the Proper Dharma and must have made a vow to practice it again.Now that you have been exposed to Mahayana Pure Land, you should give your all to attain rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land this very life time. You should extensively seek and draw near a Good Knowing Adviser to look for ways to maximize your chances of rebirth. The fact that you are still here probably means that you did not practice the proper Pure Land methodology. Please remember that you must pass many sincerity tests before you are taught.​Just in case you fail again this time, plant a lot of blessings: that is, widely practice giving, vigorously practice, and make vows. In brief, accrue a lot of blessings with Mahayana. The more blessings you have, the more you can benefit.
