# Touched by Master

Question:Na Mo Fundamental Teacher Shakyamuni Buddha:Please kindly instruct me!It hurts me deeply to talk about this.One day, a monk that I really admired the most embraced me. As I was still stupefied, he asked me whether or not I was attracted to him. I immediately answered that I was not. He instantly apologized to me. Afterward, I thought about it and told myself that I was not interested in him and yet he chose to embrace the dust and he was not actually embracing my body.Ven. Master, is my thinking correct? Or am I just fooling myself?Thank you for your helpâ€‹LHM      Answer:I am very sorry about your unfortunate experience with your spiritual teacher.As an apology, I ask for your forgiveness for the shortcomings of my fellow monks and nuns. We are trying to work on ending our sexual desires. As such, many of us are still struggling quite a bit with it.Having said that, it was most inappropriate for that monk to make unsolicited advances toward you.Again, I share in your pain.You have two choices:Report it to the abbot. It would help that young monk in the long run in that it forced him to face his strong desires and decide whether or not the spiritual path is for him.Leave the temple if the abbot does not side with you and protect you from slander or criticism. This is beneficial to you because you are pursuing the path of truthfulness.
