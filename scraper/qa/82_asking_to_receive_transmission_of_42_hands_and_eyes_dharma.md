# Asking to receive transmission of 42 Hands & Eyes Dharma

​Question:Ven. Master,I read Great Master Xuan Hua’s explanation of the Great Compassion Mantra. It made me sincerely want to practice the 42 Hands & Eyes Dharma. Please help me fulfill my wish.​HS      ​Answer:Unfortunately, I am not authorized to transmit this particular Dharma. I know of some sanghans who are but I am not at liberty to divulge their names. As far as I know, it’s their responsibility to transmit this Dharma to the next generation.It takes a lot of blessings and virtue to receive transmission of this Dharma.You might make yourself a more suitable “Dharma Vessel” (someone worthy to receive transmission of a Dharma) by doing the following:Recite the Great Compassion Mantra 108 times every day.Resolve to practice the Great Vehicle Dharmas.Resolve to serve Mahayana.Act as a Dharma Protector of Mahayana cultivators, especially those who practice the Hands & Eyes etc…​When you have enough blessings and virtue, this Dharma will come to you.
