# Can’t recite Great Compassion Mantra regularly as vowed

Question:Ven. Master!I am a lay Buddhist disciple.I encountered the Great Compassion Mantra and became enamored with it. Thus I vowed to the Buddha and Guan Yin Bodhisattva that I would maintain the Mantra in order to dedicate the merit and virtue from such recitations to my past creditors.I also hoped that my family would become vegetarian. However, recently my workload has increased so much that I could not recite the Mantra regularly anymore. This makes me feel very guilty.I hope that you will teach me the proper recitation method so that I can properly repent for my failure to keep my vow to the Buddha, Bodhisattvas and Gods because it was never my intention to make false promises to them. This failure makes me very worried and scared.Please kindly teach me. I hope to hear from you soon.​LA      Answer:There is no need to be worried or scared.If you cannot keep your resolve then find the time to visit a Way Place. Get in front of them and ask for forgiveness. Then ask for permission to retract your vow.​Try again when you have the chance.
