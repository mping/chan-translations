# Can I have your tooth relic

Question:Dear Sir, Madam,We are spreading the Buddhism in Sydney Australia. I live in the western Sydney where Muslims and Christians are majority in our area. ​The people from different religion do not want us to spread the Buddhism in our area.Would you please be able to donate hair relic or tooth relic to us?A single tiny bit will do. We need relic to protect us from danger and guide us to Dhamma journey.Thank you very much.Regards,​DMZLA      Answer:We applaud your lofty goals and endeavors in trying to propagate the Dharma in the Sydney area.It takes thorough knowledge of the Dharma to know what to teach to each individual and enough samadhi power to handle skepticism, derision and even abuse.As such, it seems that you are inadequately equipped for the journey, in spite of your great ideal.Additionally, we cannot comply with your request because of two major reasons:We have not authenticated these relics. If they are fake, aren’t you setting up unreasonable hope that may damage your credibility? You should first verify that the relics are authentic before making such a request.If our shariras are authentic, we cannot simply send these sacred Buddhist artifacts to unknown people and expect them to take care of them properly.I have been teaching the Dharma in the US for several years without any support or encouragement from any Buddhist organization. Although there is much skepticism and at times oppression from the various religious groups, I never felt I needed any protection or help. If the Dharma is Proper, in time people will eventually believe because they obtain real great benefits from it.My best wishes,
