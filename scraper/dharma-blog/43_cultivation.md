The ancients taught:When seeing a superior person, one should imitate him or her. When seeing an inferior person, one should examine oneself to make corrections.We should try our best to reinforce our righteousness and get rid of our faults.​Those who criticize us appropriately are our teachers; those who praise us appropriately are our friends; and those who flatter us are our enemies.      That is why the superior man highly respects his teachers, values his friends, loathes his enemies and never hears enough of the true principles. If these instructions are followed, one cannot help but achieve success. * * * * *  If you ever wonder how to teach your children, use the above as a blueprint for success in life.​Furthermore, teach them to help others in order to reduce selfishness and to have a more meaningful and purposeful life.
