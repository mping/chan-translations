# Two Kinds of Teachers

There was a Caucasian Chan student who took refuge with a Japanese Zen master. He came to our temple in order to learn more about Mahayana. He was well-educated and wished to devote his life to Buddhism to help others. He planned to follow the Japanese tradition of new Sangha where left-home people can marry and have a family.      ​I suggested that he consider leaving the home life and devote his life to learn Mahayana. In summary here are the reasons I gave. I told him that there are two kinds of teachers:There are those who know they are confused but insist on teaching and helping others. These teachers are simply teaching for selfish reasons because in reality, they are not furthering their students’ spiritual development. Their followers would have no choice but to continue revolving on the Reincarnation Wheel.Then there are those who know they are confused and therefore refrain from guiding others. They choose not to teach until they fully understand the Way to Liberation. Only then can they truly help.After thorough consideration, the young Chan student decided to leave the home life and train with us. For Mahayana to prosper in the West, we need more of these dedicated individuals.
