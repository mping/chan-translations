# Owning a Gem

In ancient China, a commoner brought a gem to offer to an official. The official refused to accept. The man said,“The jeweller informs me that it is a high quality gem. That is why I decided to offer up to you. It would be a great honor if you would accept it.”​The official said, “You own an authentic gemstone. My lack of greed is also a gem. If I accept your gift then we’d both lose. Isn’t it better that you bring your gem back home, that way we both still have our treasures?”      * * * * *  The ancients knew how to live: people below are grateful to those of higher status, who in turn take care of them as if they are family. As consequence, the country was at peace and prosperous.​Furthermore, the gem in your heart is worth many times the gem on the outside.
