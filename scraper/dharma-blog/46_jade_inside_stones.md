# Jade Inside Stones

A jade craftsman went to the stone market and bought a stone. He broke it up and retrieved a block of jade. The jade is of the top-notch quality. As a result, the jade craftsman became very wealthy.​The stone merchant who sold the stone heard of the story and felt that his stones must also contain jade. Therefore, he broke up all the stones in the shop looking for jade. Not only did he waste time and sweat, he ended up with useless stones without finding any jade and was scolded bitterly by his wife. * * * * *         ​Worldly people tend to be too greedy. Good things come our way usually because of our skills just like the jade craftsman who could recognize stones that could possibly contain jade. It is therefore better to hone our skills instead of relying on luck.​As to the savvy Buddhist, we recognize that good things come our way because we planted good causes in the past. If we have insufficient blessings, being greedy is just wishful thinking. If one wishes for more wealth soon, it essential to practice giving more generously and to maintain our moral compass.
