# Two Things We Should Teach Our Children

​Today, my disciple stopped by before going to school, saying that he is starting First Grade. I told him that I was very proud of him (I knew him since he was four and he became my disciple at the age of four or five). I asked him to be a good boy: listen and be respectful to his teachers and not fight with his classmates.       I hope that all the parents will teach their children about the importance of being respectful toward the teachers, especially even when one disagrees with one’s teachers.Furthermore, we should all observe our children’s behavior. When they fight, we should seize the opportunity to teach them to behave civilly (when in disagreement) advise them to learn to yield in order not to hurt others.Now, allow me to emphasize this to my children parents. If your children are disrespectful and like to fight, you should look into your own heart: you will see that most likely, they learned it from you. If you really want to teach your children, you would resolve to be more respectful toward your teachers and elders and yield more often instead of fighting.​Peace and happiness to all.
