# Leaving in White, Coming Home in Black

A man decided to go for a stroll to enjoy the good weather. When he left his home, he was in white clothing. Half way through his promenade, it rained and he was drenched. His relative whose home was nearby lent him some dark clothes to wear.      and tried to bite him. He got upset, grabbed a stick wanting to hit the dog. His brother came out of the house and stopped him, saying, “You should not mind the dog. His behavior is reasonable. If you saw him leave all white and when he returned he was all black, you could not help but become suspicious too!”* * * * *Such is the nature of knowledge: the more we know the more we are attached to the knowledge.​Therefore, those who truly understand would avoid debates and asserting their righteousness.
