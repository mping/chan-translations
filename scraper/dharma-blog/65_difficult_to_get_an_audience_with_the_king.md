# Difficult to Get an Audience with the King

​To Tan had to wait for three days before he could get an audience with the King.After he presented his thoughts, he prepared to take his leave.​The King said: “I heard that you are a man of great talent and wisdom. You traveled a long distance to come here. Why are you leaving in such a hurry?”       To Tan replied: “I observed and saw that in this country food is as expensive as jade, firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, officials are harder to see than ghosts and to get an audience with the king is like trying to see God Almighty. Why would your Highness advise me to stay to eat jade, burn cinnamon, depend on ghosts and seek God?”The King said: “You are so right! Please do stay.”*****That kingdom later became stronger and more prosperous thanks to To Tan’s help. It was because the King has wisdom.​Wise people understand that great advice is hard on the ears.​
