# Zeng Zi and Humility

​In ancient China, there was a sagely man called KL. He would not compromise himself and therefore decided to join the court. Many kings came offering official positions but he turned them all down.He was so poor that when he passed away, they had to use an old worn out blanket that was too short to cover his body.Zeng Zi, a well-known Confucian scholar, came to pay respect.       Zeng Zi suggested that if the blanket is slanted, it would cover the whole body.KL’s wife replied: “Covering the body with cloth on a slant is not as preferable as falling short and leaving it straight. When my husband was alive, he was so straight and honest that we now ended up like this. I believe that he would not agree to slanting the blanket.”Zeng Zi remained silent because he could find no retort. Later he asked for her opinion about a posthumous title for KL (Posthumous names usually reflect the deceased moral character).She replied: “My husband was never sad because we were poor. He was never impressed because others are rich. He should be named “Peaceful and Blissful”.”Zeng Zi uttered in admiration: “Such a husband! Such a wife!”* * * * *How many wives would endure a life of poverty when their husband could have chosen social status and wealth?​In my humble opinion, KL’s wife is at least his equal!
