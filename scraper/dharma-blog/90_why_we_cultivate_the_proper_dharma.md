# Why We Cultivate the Proper Dharma

Life is a struggle between Good and Evil. In this Dharma Ending Era, the ghosts and demons are proliferating and prevailing over the good and sagely.Ghosts and demons are in the destruction business: they aim to create havoc and destroy the world as we know it. Ironically, they will eventually succeed in their endeavors which will result in their own destruction.       The Buddha says that as long as there are people who cultivate the Proper Dharma, the ghosts and demons will be kept in check. To this end, the Buddhist left home people recite the Shurangama Mantra every day because it said that as long as one person can recite this Mantra, the ghosts and demons will behave. The Mantra can subdue all demonic forces and thus protect the ghosts and demons from themselves.Cultivators of Mahayana radiate a positive energy and can emit a bright light of wisdom that will chase away the forces of darkness. Therefore, the Triple Jewel should be revered and protected because they are doing a lot more good than they would ever want to take credit for. This is how you can become Buddhas: by giving to and helping others and not wishing to take credit for your good deeds.â€‹If you really understand this, you would never think that left home people are irresponsible because they shirk their responsibilities to society. Nothing could be further from the truth.
