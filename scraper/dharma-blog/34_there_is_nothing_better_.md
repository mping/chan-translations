# There is nothing better …

The ancients said,“There is nothing more skilled than practice: Therefore, children will be reminded to do their homework: that is their duty. Adults must patiently hone their skills in order to perfect them.There is nothing more peaceful than patience: Life is full of obstacles and challenges when we just want to be left alone. When we cannot run away from our problems and challenges, we must learn to patiently endure them: the storm will blow over.      There is nothing more rewarding than to do good. Such is the cause, such is the effect. Do good and good things will be done to you.There is no one better than a virtuous person. They are an important element of the social fabric. Virtuous people are actually true pillars of society.”* * * * *  Practicing Chan meditation is one of the best ways to quickly develop and increase our patience.
