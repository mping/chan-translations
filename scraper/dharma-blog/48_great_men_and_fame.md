# Great Men and Fame

Great men value their reputation and are not greedy for fame.​To value one’s reputation is to acquire knowledge and wisdom. One chooses to live by the principles of propriety (and not violate the rules and regulations). One decides to exemplify loyalty, self-respect, and bravery (and not fear loss or death).      To be greedy for fame is to fawn over and kowtow to those with influence and power.  One who desires recognition may exhibit a strange or different style, and will take no stand while straddling both fences.​Those who value fame may be silent but make sense. Those who are greedy for notoriety may be impressive but have no substance. * * * * *  Fame is rather short lived. And yet, people are so addicted to it.When the Buddha was in the world, he was widely respected by many people. A great many of them went on to respect and follow deviant teachers too.Personally, many of my followers really believed and praised me until they disagreed with me because my teaching ruffled their ego. Some of these people became my loudest critics.My teacher, the late Ven. Xuan Hua, was highly revered during his life time. He seemed to become even more famous after he passed away. Those who do not seem to be impressed are still very attached to their ego.
