# Don’t Be So Inflexible!

​The ancients said the following:Heavens cannot make flowers bloom out of season. Therefore, sages observe timeliness.Mother Earth cannot change the seasons. Therefore, sages do not violate traditions.      Even the sages cannot walk with their hands or grab things with their feet. Therefore, sages must know their limitations.And sages cannot make fish fly or birds swim. Therefore, sages must respect others’ limitations.​Thus, wise people know when to advance, when to retreat; when to be clear, when to be vague.One should not be inflexible.*****​​Clear-headed people and wise people can see farther and broader (the big picture). That’s from the theoretical perspective.However, Buddhism has the concept of the “obstruction of what is known”: it’s your own smarts, knowledge or wisdom that will obstruct and impede you.​In that case, the faster way to resolve it is to follow your Good Knowing Adviser’s instructions.
