# Sticking to One’s Gun

A man found a jade stone in the mountain. He offered it up to the king of the country.The king asked his jeweler to examine it and said it was not jade. The king therefore ordered that the man’s left foot be cut off as punishment.​Then after the crown prince succeeded his father to the throne, that man offered up the jade stone to the new king. His jeweler proclaimed that it was not jade either. So, the new king ordered the man’s right foot be cut off as punishment.      Then another new king succeeded to the throne. That man hugged his jade stone and cried bitterly for three days and three nights to the point that he was crying blood. The new king heard of the story and asked him why he cried.The man replied, “I am not crying for my feet. I am just bitter about the fact that my jade was mistaken as stone. My truthful words were deemed as untrue!” * * * * *  Worldly people are confused. They often take what is untrue to be true and what is true to be untrue.​It takes a lot of courage to stick to one’s gun and be truthful when facing adversity. Nevertheless, it is one’s responsibility as a human being to be truthful.
