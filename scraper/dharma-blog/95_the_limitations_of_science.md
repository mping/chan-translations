# The Limitations of Science

​In the past, I have received a lot of questions on the scientific proof of Buddhism. I am no scientist and therefore I can only offer the following limited view.Science continues to evolve; therefore it still does not know everything. ​For example, there are some Nobel of Science laureates who believe in God, spirits, etc. In contrast, there are also some others who would say that such beliefs are sheer nonsense. ​       In general, scientific knowledge is confined to the domain of validating their hypotheses. Case in point, Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was initially refuted by scientists and was not fully accepted until decades later, when the field of science had evolved to a level where it could prove this theory through empirical evidence.I choose to believe in The Buddha’s explanations because his domain is this entire universe. With his Buddha Eye, there is nothing he cannot see and therefore he does not have the limitations like those found in science. For instance, scientists have yet to understand the inner working of the mind and they never will. This is because their discovery is still based on their limited sense organs.Therefore, the Buddhist should rely on science if it is within their domain. Otherwise, it is better to put faith in those who have true Wisdom and infallible Knowledge.
