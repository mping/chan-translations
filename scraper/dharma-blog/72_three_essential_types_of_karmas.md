# Three Essential Types of Karmas

​As the Buddha recollects his journey to Buddhahood, he said that throughout his wanderings on the Reincarnation Wheel, he accomplished many meritorious acts. As a result, his existences were: blissful, desirable, pleasing, charming, and endearing.        Blissful: filled with pleasures that far exceeded all sensual pleasures.Desirable: others envied what he had.Pleasing: he was satisfied.Charming: he was liked and admired.Endearing: he was adored and pampered.He further explained that we too should also focus on three types of karmas:Giving: donate generously.Self-control: refrain from doing evil, do only goodGood will: do not harbor anger, have compassion for all living beings.* * * * *​People often point out to me that there are many cases where those who do evil deeds got away with it.​I believe that most of us do not really believe so because it would contradict the Law of Cause and Effect: that is, if you create bad karma, you will reap bad consequences. The evil doers may appear to have desirable results but their existence can hardly be described as blissful, desirable, pleasing, charming or endearing.
