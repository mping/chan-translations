# One Weight Loss Strategy

​One very effective way to lose weight is to meditate, but not with just any kind of meditation! Meditate with the expressed purpose of increasing your self-awareness.​You are overweight because you eat excessively. You eat excessively because you have triggers that compel you to consume food and drink. Recognize those triggers and then half of the problem will be solved.       For example, one such trigger is anger. Another one is being unhappy. And yet another one is being depressed. I used to know a twenty-something lady who, when depressed, would grab a box of cereal, retire to a quiet place and load up on carbohydrates. One major cause is feeling bad. When we feel bad, food provides us comfort which can be addictive. Make a list of those triggers so that you can spot them quickly. The quicker you can recognize them, the easier it is to neutralize them.The other half of the solution is to resist the temptation to eat until it passes.​Again, meditation skills can be very helpful because good meditators learn to become more patient and therefore are better equipped to “wait” until the urge to eat “blows” over.Of course, if you insist on being self-indulgent, then never mind; nothing can help!
