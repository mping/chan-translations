# Teaching Children About Righteousness

Part of the makeup of a good and meaningful life is righteousness. Righteousness is defined as the state of being morally right or justifiable. It is also known as virtue.What do the ancients have to say about a righteous life?They say, “If each day, we can hear of one righteous thing, see one righteous thing being done and do one righteous thing, then that day would not have been in vain.”How can we teach our children about righteousness? To rely on our educators whose promotions are not based on teaching righteousness would be inadequate.       ​Instead, each day, help them hear, see and do something righteous by being such an example. That is how we can help ensure our children will have a good future.  * * * * *  As Buddha did three thousand years ago, the best way to teach is by being a good role model. One of the most important responsibilities of good parents is to teach by example.
