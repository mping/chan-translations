# Providing One’s Mother with Proper Earnings

Roãn Thuần was taking the Imperial Examination. The topic of the required essay was “Killing the loyalists of the prior regime” (in order to be loyal to the current king). Roãn Thuần immediately stood up and left.​He immediately reported to his teacher and declared that he was done with taking Imperial Examinations. His wise teacher said, “How do you plan to provide for your aging mother?”      Roãn Thuần  went home straight away and explained the situation to his elderly mother.She told him, “I prefer that you support me with properly earned income rather than with illicit gains.”When Roãn Thuần’s teacher heard her response, he exclaimed, “Like mother like son!”* * * * *​Those who are willing to betray previous good kings for personal gain are not good members of society.Illicit earnings, no matter how nutritious or delicious, are difficult to digest and can also be detrimental to our good nature.The lady’s virtuous conduct is based on the Buddhist principle of cause and effect. For example, when we steal from others, the benefits derived are actually karmic debts that must repaid plus interest. Those, such as the family members, who also benefit from such illicit profit, are also responsible for their corresponding share of the karmic debts repayment.
