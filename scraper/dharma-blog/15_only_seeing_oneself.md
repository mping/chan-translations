# Only Seeing Oneself

​The ancient said:​“Man often commits the myriad of offenses because of this illness called, “Only Seeing Oneself”. Because of this sickness, he schemes night and day in order to become richer, climbs up the social ladder, strengthens one’s safety net, indulges in pleasures, assures one’s survival, lengthens one’s life while not caring whether or not others are poor and destitute, experiences danger and difficulty, and fails miserably or loses his life. In other words, he doesn’t care for other living beings and has no respect for the rules of morality and propriety. Therefore, he may have a human body, but he is no better than an animal.      If mankind could get rid of this “Me First” sickness and their hearts are generous and fair, then whether rich and lofty, poor and lowly, endangered and suffering, experiencing bitter failure, in danger of losing their lives, they still are in communion with all others and in accord with the rules of morality and propriety: that is truly self and others united in one substance.”* * * * *Modern society’s recent developments can be attributed to the culture of the individual. However, in order to ensure continued advancements, we must wake up to the necessity of benefitting others as part of our moral compass. Otherwise, if we continue to self-indulge, our bottomless greedy mind will cause great harm to the world.
