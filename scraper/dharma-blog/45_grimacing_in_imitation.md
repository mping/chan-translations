# Grimacing in Imitation

In ancient China, in the country of Yue, there was a famously known beauty called XiShi 西施. She was so beautiful that even when she had a stomach ache, although she would bend over and grimace, she was still irresistible.​In her village, there was woman who saw all that had happened. Because she was shallow and conceited, this woman assumed that she could win the hearts of all that saw her, just as XiShi did.        When she returned home, she feigned sickness and imitated XiShi to the full extent. She bent over and grimaced, thinking that she made herself beautiful. However, when the villagers caught sight of her, they thought that she was a ghost or demon. The rich ran back home and locked their doors, not daring to venture outside. The poor carried their children to safety, grabbing hold of their wives and ran for their lives. * * * * *  Worldly people value physical beauty more than moral beauty.​My late teacher, Great Master XuanHua, was so kind and compassionate that even when he frowned and screamed and yelled, we still adored him.
