# Dyeing Silk

​The Chinese philosopher Mo Zi  墨子, saw silk being dyed and had the following realization: It turns green when a green dye is used, and yellow when a yellow dye is used. Silk takes on the color of the dye that is used. Dye it five times, it will change color five times: therefore, one must use the dye carefully.      Furthermore, people can have similar dyeing effect on each other. Get close to someone good and you’ll become a good person. Befriend a bad person and you’ll become a bad person. Fame or infamy largely depends on with whom you associate.* * * * *   Mo Zi can only see at the friend level but cannot see it at the teacher’s level. In Buddhism, great success or great failure largely depends on the Good Knowing Adviser.
