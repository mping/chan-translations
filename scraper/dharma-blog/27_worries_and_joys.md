# Worries and Joys

Zi Lu, a famous disciple of Confucius, asked the wise teacher, “The superior man has worries too?”Confucius replied, “The superior man is only concerned with the task under consideration. When he hasn’t started yet, he’s happy that he has aspirations and resolve. After he completes the task, he is happy that he is competent and smart. Therefore, the superior only knows happiness and has no worries.​In contrast, the small man, when he still hasn’t completed the task, he’s worried that he can’t. And if he’s successful, he’s afraid to lose it. That is why the small person only has worries his entire life.”       * * * * * Worldly people have many worries because their greed has no bounds.​The superior man only is greedy to help others. That is why he is happy for trying his best instead of being attached to results.
