# On the Noble Position of an Official

A wise official of old said to a newly appointed official, “An official works for the citizens and it’s not the case that the citizens must serve the official. People pay taxes in order to pay for the official’s salary in order for the official to administer justice for the populace. Unfortunately, it is so sad to see that nowadays, the official collects his salary but is tardy at administering public work and in some cases even steals from the citizens.      Now that you are coming into this important official position, you should get up early in the morning and work into late at night to administer to your duties. You must diligently apply yourself to your civic duties, give out fair judgments on law suits, set fair and reasonable fees, treat the old and young equitably. Only then would you have justly earned your salary.”*****​​This applies to public servants at all levels, including politicians.One can employ rhetoric as one pleases. The bottom line is that great officials will bring prosperity and security to the nation. Lousy ones will hurt the treasury and weaken the nation’s standing in the world. History will have the final word.
