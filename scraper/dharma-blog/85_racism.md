# Racism

​There was a family that raised pigs for profit.​They had a black swine that gave birth to three piglets. Two were black and one was black with white areas like a Dalmatian. The mother swine took great care of the two pitch black offspring. In contrast, she mistreated her black and white piglet and eventually even bit it to death.   					 							 		 	       Isn’t that a common behavior among mankind? When we share the same beliefs, the same race, the same skin color, the same religion, the same aspirations then we like and support each other. Or else, we often give rise to suspicion, jealousy and hatred.​People of virtue would never love or hate based on form or shape; or unite or segregate based on beliefs. Nor would they consider one as a friend because they are the same and label someone else as a foe because they are different. Even when the others do not share the same blood, race, work or belief as us, we should still love and support them. That is called being human.
