# Is the Sun Closer or Further?

Confucius was strolling in the open field. He ran into two kids who were arguing adamantly with each other.​One claimed that the sun was closer to the earth at sunrise and further from it at noon. The other maintained just the very opposite.      The first kid justified his position by maintaining that at sunrise the sun was as big as the wheel of a cart while it was only the size of a bowl at noon time.The second kid argued that at sunrise the sun felt cool therefore it had to be further from earth whereas the sun felt hot at noon and therefore it had to be closer.As they turned to Confucius for arbitrage, the wise man could not help.So the two kids laughed aloud and said: “And they say that you have wisdom?”Confucius smiled and strolled on.* * * * *No one can live long enough to learn everything because knowledge is boundless. Even the wisest amongst us such as the sages and Bodhisattvas cannot know everything.Therefore, the truly wise are humble and never think that they are better than others. Moreover, the sages would never waste time in arguing or proving that they are right.​Real wisdom is in being able to accept another’s wrong opinion as right.
