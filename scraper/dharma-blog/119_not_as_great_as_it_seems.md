# Not as great as it seems

The older buffalo told its brother: “See?Do not envy that pig’s food.What it ate was not for its own good.Be content with your chaff.It means long life on your behalf. ”   					 							 		 	       One day, the younger buffalo told its older brother: “You know our owner also has a pig. It does nothing all day long. And yet, it gets to stay in a (pig) sty and fed rice and porridge, celery and vegetables. We only get grass and straw even though we do so much more for our owner. That is not fair!”The older buffalo said: “Never mind! It’s not what you think. Just wait a few more weeks and you’ll understand.”A few weeks later, the pig got real fat and happy. It was also then the celebration of the marriage of the owner’s daughter. The pig was dragged out of the sty. Somehow it knew and started squealing loudly, desperately. It was slaughtered, chopped up into bits and devoured by the guests.The older buffalo told its brother: “See?Do not envy that pig’s food.What it ate was not for its own good.Be content with your chaff.It means long life on your behalf. ”​There is no need to be envious. It’s better to work hard and be content with what we can get.
