# Engaging in Battles

The ancients have the following rules regarding when to not to go into battle:When the country is disharmonious, do not try to conquer new territories.When the army is disharmonious, do not engage in battles.When engaged in a battle and the army is disharmonious, do not advance the army.When advancing the army while it is disharmonious, do not try win the battle at any cost.The people must feel that their leaders engage in thorough planning, carefully evaluating all options and valuing the people’s lives for them to make sacrifices for the good of the country.​      This applies to the country as well as the family at the micro level. The key is to expand externally, the unit (whether it’s a country or a company or a family) must be in harmony. Harmony must be established first before important undertakings can begin.​
