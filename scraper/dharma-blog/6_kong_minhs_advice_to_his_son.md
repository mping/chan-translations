# Kong Minh’s Advice to His Son

The Chinese man, who was the personification of intelligence, cleverness and loyalty, once wrote a letter of advice to his son.“...The superior man must be still and pure in order to cultivate. He must know moderation to nurture virtue. If one is not calm and dispassionate then one cannot be clear-headed. Deep knowledge requires quietude, lack of rashness and no temper.To study one must be still and pure. Talented people still need to study or else their talents are narrow in scope. Lacking stillness and purity then one cannot really study. Laziness and arrogance will preclude thorough knowledge. Viciousness and brute force prevent reforming one’s character.​Each year the body ages and becomes weaker and sick. To sigh and lament of missed opportunities would only be in vain...”      The Asian culture stresses cultivating one’s body and mind and nurturing one’s virtue. One must strive to develop talent and knowledge.​Buddhists are taught to cultivate morality, samadhi and wisdom which will help us realize our highest potential.
