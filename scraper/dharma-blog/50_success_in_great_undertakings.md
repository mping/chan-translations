# Success in Great Undertakings

A great general believed in upholding the following statements regarding the four disharmonies:​When the country is disharmonious, we should not send the army to war.When the army is disharmonious we should not send it to battle.When the army is disharmonious at the battlefront we should not advance into a battle.While advancing against the enemy and there is harmony we should not fight to the end.      Therefore, the ruler must make sure that society is harmonious in order to accomplish great undertakings and should not solely count on any single individual. If the people believe that their leaders are knowledgeable and have done their homework exhaustively, (as well as value competency and cherish human lives), then the general public will not hesitate to give their all to serve.*****Even within Buddhism, there is much emphasis in harmony in the sangha through the Six Harmonies Dharma (1. Harmonious in body karma, they dwell; 2. Harmonious in mouth karma, they do not fight; 3. Harmonious in mind, they are happy; 4. Harmonious in precepts, they practice; 5. Harmonious in view, they share the same understanding; 6. Harmonious in benefits, they equally share.)​In this Dharma-ending era, if we wish to propagate Mahayana, we must train a competent sangha and at the same time create harmony amongst them or else Mahayana will not prosper.
