# The Crazy Fool

​There was a crazy man. He would roll in the mud, step on thorns and bristles. He was always content with himself and always argued to prove that he was right. He later met with a competent doctor who was able to cure him. As a result, he gradually became better and became completely well.      His friends and relatives would recount his prior condition to him. He shuddered, and felt that he was very blessed to have encountered a good physiscian who cured him and spared him from a life of misery. He even wished he could have met with the good doctor sooner. * * * * *   This world has so many crazy people that cannot be cured. And there are many other crazy ones who can be cured but would refuse treatment. They would even insult the good physician as a charlatan who would try to fool them. The crazy fool symbolizes a person blinded by his greed, anger and stupidity: he’s totally upside-down and yet believes that he’s right.  He insists on having his way, refuses treatment and would insult the good doctors who can put an end to his suffering.
