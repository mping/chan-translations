# Sharing Love

​The Emperor had just selected a new royal concubine whose beauty was out of this world. Therefore, he adored her and doted on her. The empress knew so, and thus she also showed adoration for the new concubine and showered her with favors and gifts so that the new royal concubine was lacking in nothing.      ​The Emperor was very pleased and praised the empress: “My wife really adores the new royal concubine. I’d say that at times she loves and spoils her more than I. This typifies the son being filial to his parents and the subject being loyal to his king.” Knowing that she had gained everyone’s confidence, the empress said to the new royal concubine, “The Emperor really loves you. However, he doesn’t like the look of your nose. Therefore, you should cover your nose in his presence: that way, he’ll favor you forever.” So the new royal concubine did as taught. The Emperor was surprised about her behavior and thus asked the empress who said she didn’t know. When pressed, she finally admitted to the Emperor that the royal concubine told her that she could not stand the Emperor’s body odor. Hearing this, the Emperor lost his temper and ordered that the royal concubine’s nose be cut and thrown out of the palace door.  * * * * *   Can love ever be shared?
