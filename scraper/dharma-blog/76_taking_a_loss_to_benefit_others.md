# Taking a Loss to Benefit Others

​Mencius was visiting his old friend who advised him: “No one cares to benefit society anymore. Why would you suffer to help others? How can one individual make a difference?”   					 							 		 	       Mencius replied: “Suppose your family has 10 children. Only one works in the fields while the remaining nine loaf around. Doesn’t the single working child have to work harder because there are more mouths to feed? Now that no one wants to take a loss to benefit society, shouldn’t you advise me to sacrifice myself even more?”* * * * *Small people seek to benefit themselves only at the expense of the community.Virtuous people do what is right even at their own expense.​Wise people do the right thing but no longer see it as personal sacrifices.
