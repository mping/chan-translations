# Lost A Bow

The king of the Sở country was on a hunting trip. He misplaced his bow. His entourage was actively looking for it but he said, “Never mind! A man from Sở lost a bow, a man from Sở would find it: there is no loss!”When Confucius heard of the story, he sighed, “The Sở king is such a small thinker! Why did he specify Sở people? Wouldn’t it be better that he said,“A man lost a bow, another man will find it”?”      ​* * * * *​The king of Sở was a generous and considerate monarch. He did not want to bother his people and he wanted to benefit them. Yet Confucius still thought less of him because the king only knew of taking care of his own people: his humaneness was not broad enough to include all of humanity.​In these modern times, history seems to repeat itself. The Chinese king puts his country first. The American king only cares for his people at the expense of all others. People are divided over political ideologies instead uniting themselves to build goodness. To proclaim, “Let’s make America great again!” will only have the opposite effect.
