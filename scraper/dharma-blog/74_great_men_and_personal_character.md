# Great Men and Personal Character

For the sake of the world great men value their personal character and avoid compromising themselves. To value one’s personal character, one should reduce desire, be less greedy and disengage from plotting for fame and profit. ​      One should reduce one’s anger and exercise moderation in eating and drinking.To compromise oneself is to constantly be calculating for fame and profit and to focus on avoiding trouble and difficulties. One compromises oneself to seek power and fortify one’s position in all areas including family affairs and household matters.Those who value their personal character may be silent but are heard by the masses. Those who compromise their personal character may be content but are dismissed by many.* * * * *​Men with character focus on improving themselves by correcting their mistakes. They are self-critical and humble.Men without character focus on proving their superiority by pointing out others’ mistakes. They are conceited and boastful.
