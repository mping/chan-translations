# Difficult to Draw

​A master painter offered some of his works to the king.The king asked, “What is difficult to draw?”The artist replied, “Drawing dogs or horses is rather difficult.”“What is easy to draw?” The king pursued.​“Ghosts and spirits.” was the reply.​“Why is that?” The king asked.       The master artist said, “Dogs or horses are easily recognized by everyone. Therefore if one does a lousy job, people will easily recognize it and would ridicule you. Therefore it is difficult to draw dogs or horses. On the other hand, ghosts and spirits are invisible. You can follow your imagination and few would know any better!”* * * * *The divine is in the ordinary.The remarkable man is the one who dutifully does his share of the work day after day to the best of his ability.Conversely, there are people who prefer the extraordinary or unusual so as to impress others. They are no different than those who paint ghosts and spirits.
