# On No Thoughts

Most meditation approaches laud lesser results such as spiritual penetrations, good feelings (that make you “smile”), etc. In contrast, a major objective of Chan meditation is to realize the state of No Thoughts.The state of No thoughts can simply described as:​No physical activities: For example, when beaten, those who attained No Thoughts do not have any physical reactions such as cowering in fear, retaliating lunch for punch, or being startled.No verbal reactions: For example, when insulted you will not insult back or raise your voice.No mental actions: For example, when praised, you will not even feel pleased with yourself.      In other words, you have no external reactions with your body and mouth and no internal reactions by mental activities.That is called having real Samadhi power.That is called possessing real transcendental wisdom.​That is True Bliss.
