# I Voted

​One of my disciples asked me who to vote for on the upcoming election.I explained that under the current circumstances, it was better to vote for such and such candidates.​However, I also explained that I have not voted for a long time because of the following reasons:      I no longer participate in or discuss politics. I believe in a clear separation of Church and State and therefore, religious leaders should in no way influence politics.People often sarcastically say that it is about voting for the lesser of two evils. Be it as it may, I feel that I should not vote for any evil at all.I have a hard time voting for a person who knowingly misleads people no matter how well-intentioned he or she is.I will only vote for a virtuous candidate.Finally, I prefer not to vote so as to nurture a non-discriminating mind.
