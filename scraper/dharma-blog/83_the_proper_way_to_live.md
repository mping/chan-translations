# The Proper Way to Live

Yan Hui, Confucius’ wisest disciple asked: “I want to be poor but as if I am rich, lowly but as if I am of high station, lacking in physical strength but as if I can command respect, and indulge myself my entire life without any fear. Is that reasonable?”      Confucius replied: “To be poor and yet feel rich, one must be content with one’s lot and be greedy for nothing. To be lowly and yet feel noble, one must be yielding and respectful. To lack in physical strength and yet feel respected, one must be cautious, respectful and avoid making mistakes. To indulge oneself all life long without any fear, one must choose one’s words carefully before speaking.”* * * * *In other words, those who know how to live:​Are very rich because they are free from desire.Have class because they know etiquette and humility.Are strong because they are cautious, respectful and do not make mistakes.Have a good time their entire lives because they choose their words carefully.
