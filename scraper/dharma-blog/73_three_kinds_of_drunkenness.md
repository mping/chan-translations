# Three Kinds of Drunkenness

​The Buddha said that there are three kinds of drunkenness:​1.  Of youth2.  Of health3.  Of lifeIt is called drunkenness because there is a lack of discernment and as a result, one engages in rash behavior.       Therefore, young people should guard against self-indulgence. They should invest time in learning and worthwhile activities so that they can take care of themselves when they get old.One should take care of one’s physical and mental health because this body will eventually become sick and should not be taken for granted.​Although life can be challenging and overwhelming, to devote all of one’s resources to it would be grossly negligent. That is exactly why we have been revolving on the Reincarnation Wheel for so long. Prepare for your next life by meditating or reciting the Buddha’s name.
