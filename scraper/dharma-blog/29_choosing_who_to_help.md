# Choosing Who To Help

Dương Hổ (DH) was a high ranking general during the Warring States era in China. He got in trouble and had to run for his life, taking refuge in a neighboring country. He asked to see a wise official Triệu Giản Tử (TGT) and declared, “From now on, I will never help anyone else.”      When prompted, DH explained, “When I was in my country, I helped over half of the attendant officials to the king get their positions. I also assisted more than half of the court officials. And more than half of the frontier officials were appointed because of my support as well. Then those attendant officials slandered me, those court officials used the letter of the law to give me a guilty verdict and those frontier officials used their own weapons against me!”​TGT said, “You are so wrong! That was from your own doing. Who asked you to help treacherous people and expect them to be grateful?” * * * * * An inferior man can only blame others for his problems instead of looking at himself and correct his shortcomings.TGT should have not even explained to DH because he’s wasting his time with such an inferior man.
