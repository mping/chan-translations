# Wei Tou Bodhisattva

“I would like to share a story, an experience I had relating to Wei Tou Bodhisattva.One day, a long time ago, I was sitting on the floor reading, 42 Chapters Sutra, explained by Master YongHua. My back began to hurt so I laid down to rest on the floor for a few minutes. I opened the book to cover my eyes and after a few minutes, I dozed off. Then, I had a strange and terrible dream. I saw a man wearing an ancient style of clothing and holding a pestle in his hand. He was furious at me, and began to chase me. His scowl was stern, severe. Referring to the book being used to cover my eyes, he admonished me. “How dare you treat the Sutra like that?” Awakened by his terrible anger, I sat bolt upright. The book fell from my face, opening to an image of Wei Tou Bodhisattva. The image matched exactly as he had appeared to me in my dream. The face, the clothes he wore, the pestle, everything. I had no doubt then, or now, that I had been visited by Wei Tou. I vowed to never disrespect any sacred object again.”​Shared by Kenix
