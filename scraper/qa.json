[{"title":"Crossed Leg up","content":"Question: Ven. Master,I have been practicing Chan by following the instructions in your Chan Handbook.I use the full lotus position but my knee does not lie flat on the floor. I could force it by tightening my back and legs but would experience pain and couldn't sit as long as before as a result.Please advise.​TL      ​Answer:It is not bad that you could force it like that. If you wish you should keep it up and your leg(s) will fall flat even faster and touch the floor. The more pain or discomfort you are willing to endure, the quicker your leg muscles and tendons will loosen and relax.​On the other hand, the average practitioner does have another way to achieve the same result: just continue to sit. In time, your legs will naturally become more flexible as your Qi becomes stronger. Then the leg(s) will naturally drop and touch the floor. Don’t be bothered until then."},{"title":"Obtain rebirth through reciting Buddha name","content":"Question:Ven. Master: I find it hard to believe that by merely reciting the Buddha’s name, I could obtain rebirth to the Pure Land. My brother said that the Sutras were altered, and that videos about rebirth used professional actors.​TT      Answer:I do not blame you for being skeptical. I would be too regarding the authenticity of your sources.Personally, I believe it because my teacher, the late Great Master Xuan Hua said so. He would not lie to me nor has he ever lied to anyone about Buddhism.Furthermore, I consult the original Buddhist Scriptures known as the Great Treasury Scriptures 大藏經.They are recognized by all Buddhist experts as the indisputable teachings of the Buddha.After you have planted more blessings with Mahayana, you too will believe."},{"title":"Stealing the 42 Hands and Eyes Dharma","content":"Question:​Ven. Masters,I am still uninformed, if what I am about to ask you is inappropriate, please forgive me.The scriptures say so and so do a lot of Dharma Masters: “All living beings are Buddhas [to be] because they inherently have Buddha seeds. Bodhisattvas do not discriminate. To encounter the sangha is like encountering the Buddhas.”      You Dharma Masters are lofty of nature and undertake teaching us to lead us to the Western Bliss Pure Land. Then why do you say that stealing the Dharma will make us fall to the hells?Please kindly clarify this for me.Thank youTQ  Answer:Please seek out a knowledgeable sangha member to clarify the rest of your assertions because that is the job of your teacher. We will restrict our answer to the matter of Dharma Theft.That was what the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas taught us. We simply passed it on to you. For example, my late teacher, Great Master Xuan Hua, said that the 42 Hands & Eyes Dharma is a Secret School Dharma that requires transmission before it can be practiced. Unfortunately, on the internet there are a lot of materials on that Dharma albeit quite inaccurate or incomplete. Furthermore, there some monks, who for the sake of fame and profit, decided to transmit them although they are not authorized to do so. Such greedy teachers will certainly fall to the hells. And so will their greedy followers.If I say the truth, you will get offended. If I fail to say it, you will blame me for being cowardly, lacking in kindness and compassion, or even being jealous of another’s success.May I suggest that you ponder these questions? If you are so greedy how can you possibly successfully practice this great Dharma? If success is not assured, is it worth falling to the hells?Furthermore, the Buddha said: “All of you should carefully reflect upon what you heard. If it does not make sense, even if it came from the Tathagata’s golden mouth, you should not believe it.” If your teacher regularly appeals to your greedy mind, should you continue to blindly follow him?​You do not have to believe me now. When you fall to the hells, at that very moment you will remember my words and will know that I did not pull your leg. Then the next time, you will be more receptive to the Proper Dharma."},{"title":"How to Receive Transmission of 42 Hands and Eyes","content":"Question:Dear Sangha,I am writing from North Bay, California. I would like to ask if there are prerequisites for receiving teaching from your monastery on the 42 hands and eyes.I am a lay Buddhist practicing from home.​I am very interested about the 42 hands and eyes dharma practice.Thank you for your guidance.Sincerely,JC      Answer:Thank you for your interest.As you already know, the 42 Hands & Eyes are a secret Buddhist Dharma that requires transmission before it can be practiced. To practice this Dharma without the transmission from an authorized master would constitute Dharma theft which is a very serious offense. First of all, if one tried to practice this Dharma without authorized transmission, one would not be able to accomplish it. Also one would be prevented from ever receiving proper transmission in the future. More seriously, having committed Dharma theft, one would fall to the lower realms upon death.Most of the available materials on the internet are inaccurate and incomplete and should be ignored. The only way to practice this Dharma is with the help of your Good Knowing Adviser.​We only transmit it to our Buddhist disciples (i.e. those who took refuge with our Master) who are selected to be Dharma Vessels by our Master, Ven. YongHua. In general, Dharma Vessels are people who are regulars to our Way place, have made significant contributions to Mahayana or wish to actively help propagate the Proper Dharma as transmitted to our Master by his teacher, Great Master XuanHua."},{"title":"Periods","content":"Question:Ven. Master:May I ask a rather delicate question that has been bothering me for quite a while? Please kindly clarify it for me. Emituofo.Master, when a woman is having her period, is appropriate for her to go to the temple? Either way, what is she supposed to pay attention to? Thank you and wishing you much accomplishment​LX      Answer:The older generation seems to discourage women from going to the temple when they have their period.That is illogical because when the Buddha was in the world, he had a lot of female left home disciples and there seemed to be no restrictions on their activities when they had their periods. We have no such restrictions at our temple because that would hinder their cultivation.​I feel that the more opportunities you have to come to the temple, the better off you will be: There is no need for any such restriction."},{"title":"Developing Mind of Compassion","content":"Question:Venerable Master,Please teach me how to develop the mind of Great Compassion when I practice. I don’t understand Great Compassion and would appreciate some instructions.​NTBL      Answer:When you practice the various Guan Yin Dharmas such as the Great Compassion Mantra, the 42 Hands & Eyes, reciting the Bodhisattva’s name or the Universal Door Chapter (of the Lotus Sutra), and bowing the Great Compassion Repentance etc… your mind of Great Compassion will naturally develop.​Should you wish to make it happen faster, find a Good Knowing Adviser at a Mahayana temple. If he has achieved Great Compassion, he can better explain it to you and help you unfold it quickly."},{"title":"Uncertain about Future","content":"Question:Dear Dharma Masters,​I have recently finished a PhD in engineering and have been involved in a startup company to commercialize my research. Unfortunately, this is a medical product and requires animal testing to get approved. ​I will not be directly involved in these experiments but the thought of it still causes me stress. Right now, we are still in the early stages and have not started any animal work yet.      In addition, I don’t think I want to follow this path. I am more interested in Buddhism and would like to volunteer and eventually leave the home-life in a monastery. However, my main obstacle is my worry for my mother, particularly who will take care of her. My father passed away years ago and my siblings right now are not financially stable and my mother makes minimum wage. I feel as if she had pegged the hopes of the family on me.What do you suggest I do? Should I drop everything and follow my heart? Or should I continue down my current path and hope conditions improve?Amituofo and thanks for your time,​MT  Answer:Good indeed! Good indeed!You have very lofty aspirations for a person of your background and achievements. The Buddhists believe that when one’s son leaves the home life, nine generations ascend to the heavens. Better yet, I feel that it is far more important to help generate blessings to help them escape the Reincarnation Wheel by cultivating the Proper Dharma.It is hard to provide good suggestions without more detail. However, we would like to point out a few major concerns for your consideration:First, it is very important to take care of your mother. It is very hard to cultivate when in the back of your mind, you are still worried about her and feel guilty that you did not try to help when you could. Perhaps one compromise is to work and save enough to take care of her financial needs. For example, a financial planner could help you figure out how much of an annuity you could set up to take care of her. It is just like the Sixth Patriarch: he took care of his mother before he set out on his spiritual journey.Equally important is to plan carefully for your spiritual journey. The ultimate goal of leaving the home life is to attain liberation so that you can then learn how to save your parents, family and all living beings. Just like earning your doctorate, you also need to choose a competent teacher and temple to maximize your chance of success. I was very lucky that I encountered Great Master Xuan Hua when I left the home life. Even more important was his guidance in cultivation: I would not trade it for anything else in the world. I later realized that I became his disciple and trained under him only because I had already planted countless blessings with his Dharma throughout many lifetimes. In brief, select a Dharma Master with a proven success rate and intensively plant your blessings with him so that you have enough blessings to accomplish his Dharma.Finally, one excellent way to discharge your filial piety to your mother is to send her to the Pure Land where she will never know suffering ever again and where she will become a Buddha in one lifetime. You can find more information on the American approach to the Pure Land Dharma in our publication, “The Pure Land Handbook: A Mahayana Approach to Birth and Death”.If you wish we will be glad to discuss with you in person after your plans become clearer.​Best wishes."},{"title":"Resolving Wife and Mother Enmity Part III","content":"Question:Dear Master,Amituofo. Thank you for the advice.Previously I went to CTTB (once to attend GuanYin dharma session) and once a year I will also go to the Guan Yin Sagely temple in Kuala Lumpur (DRBA branch).What type of help should I ask ?​In CTTB, there is a plague offering to remove past creditor debt and Karma.

It is true the conflict arise from past enmity between the two of them. Therefore, you are correct in assuming that settling the past debt will resolve the problem.2.

What is generally be transmitted.Thanks youStan Baker​SB      Answer:​As far as I can tell, there is absolutely no gap in the transmission of Chan or Mahayana Buddhism.​The gap is in in the students’ capacity to absorb the teaching. In that sense, it is true that the great teachers do not reveal themselves anymore because there are not enough qualified students (those who can absorb the teachings or can practice the Mahayana secret practices)."},{"title":"How to Encounter Proper Dharma Again","content":"Question:Ven.

You must have had a lot of blessings with the Proper Dharma and must have made a vow to practice it again.Now that you have been exposed to Mahayana Pure Land, you should give your all to attain rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land this very life time. You should extensively seek and draw near a Good Knowing Adviser to look for ways to maximize your chances of rebirth. The fact that you are still here probably means that you did not practice the proper Pure Land methodology. Please remember that you must pass many sincerity tests before you are taught.​Just in case you fail again this time, plant a lot of blessings: that is, widely practice giving, vigorously practice, and make vows.

Master,I have admired your teaching for quite a while and hope that someday I will have the opportunity to practice under your guidance. I feel very close to you. There is a feeling of familiarity with your teaching which makes me feel very happy and optimistic about life.​In Vietnam, my friends and I follow the Buddha Recitation method that contemplates a red dot on the top of Amitabha Buddha’s crown. This is under the guidance of a monk over the internet. That is why we call it a cloud temple.      We all read the articles on the web site which includes experiences from our co-cultivators. I often feel at a loss and submitted a lot of question but it seems that conditions are still not ripe yet as he has yet to give answers… May I ask for your opinion? I hope that you will compassionately answer me.​My teacher says that the full lotus posture is not good for our legs. Therefore, he suggested that we use the posture while lying down only. It seems to make sense because my experience has been that my leg became weaker and bow a little more because of that posture. However, I find that lying down makes me drowsy and seems to be encouraging self-indulging in comfort.Your Chan Handbook does not teach how to end Chan sessions.… I asked you earlier about becoming a doctor. You encouraged me to become one even though there are undesirable consequences for pursuing the ideal of healing others. How do I become a good doctor?When I recite the Buddha’s name while contemplating the red dot and following a melody, is it OK?I do not cultivate that vigorously and make a lot of mistakes. My study load is quite heavy and causes me a lot of stress. Hopefully your answers will provide me more encouragement to be more vigorous in my cultivation. I hope to be able to come to your temple to cultivate in the future when conditions ripen. ..Emituofo!​NVV  Answer: I do not normally comment on other teachers’ teaching or technique in order to avoid being perceived as jealous, insecure or envious.In this case, however, I will make an exception in order to clarify some important cultivation aspects. Furthermore, since this cloud teacher is anonymous, it cannot be construed as a personal criticism or attack.Your teacher is incorrect. He does not give you the proper technique for practicing the full lotus posture. Just follow the instructions in our Chan Handbook and you can’t go wrong. As you have found out for yourself, lying down is for sleeping, not for practicing. I would dump all of this teacher’s instructions in the trash can because his techniques are wrong.There is no need to end a Chan session. Other teachers make a big deal out of ending a meditation session properly because they tend to emphasize redundant and useless techniques.You become a better professional by adhering to the Five Precepts.No, it is not desirable to use melodies as part of your practice. Again, ditch all the techniques associated with this cloud teacher.Good teachers are trained by great teachers. Their teachers tend to be patriarchs or students of patriarchs. If you cannot find teachers such as these, then stick to Great Master Xuan Hua’s teachings. You simply cannot go wrong.One simple technique that you can use to help increase your stamina and reduce stress is to gradually learn to build your Chan skills using the full lotus technique outlined in our Chan Handbook. Simply train yourself to sit in full lotus in 2 minutes increments until you break through the first pain barrier. This will give you added stamina, faith and confidence.I am very conservative in my spiritual practice. I only learn from the patriarchs’ teachings and stick to the Mahayana methods of cultivation."},{"title":"Chan for Excessive Thinkers","content":"Question:Ven.

I have the tendency to overthink and to be lost in thoughts, which gives me a lot of stress. May I ask for your suggestions on what I could do to counteract the negative effects of excessive mental processing?Thank you very much.Bows in Respect,​MH  Answer:The best way is to learn to meditate. Go to a Chan temple to learn and obtain guidance from competent teachers.Meditate at least for one hour each day. It is very helpful for you to meditate in the morning before going to work. It will energize you for the day.At work, if you find yourself mentally exhausted then cross your legs until you recover: to continue spinning your brain would be rather unproductive.

Ever since then, every time I go out, I feel a little sad inside and also would feel guilty, especially whenever I look at the Buddha statues.       Nevertheless, I never could consistently have real self-control.Recently, I encounter the Shurangama Sutra and believed in the magical power of the Shurangama Mantra.

Master, I wish to maintain the Shurangama Mantra in order to overcome my desires, control my anger and maintain the pure precepts. I still am not vegetarian, is it Ok to maintain the Mantra?Please kindly instruct me.Emituofo,TD  Answer:The Hinayana Buddhists have a Dharma called the Contemplation of the Impure which is very effective at eliminating greed and desire. You do not need to be vegetarian, and can eat onion and garlic. Eventually, you will be able to maintain the Precepts and attain Arhatship.Still, Mahayana has many more dharma doors to deal with greed and desire. In particular, the Shurangama Mantra is most effective at eliminating sexual desire. However, it is highly advisable to be vegetarian and avoid eating the five pungent plants in order to maximize its effectiveness. You may realize enlightenment with this dharma door.You should maintain the Shurangama Mantra. In time, your desires will lessen and you will naturally be more inclined to maintain precepts, become vegetarian and with time, you will enjoy keeping the precepts.​The important thing is to find a competent good knowing adviser who can transmit to you.

Imposing your beliefs on your loved ones. Doing so against their will only result in discord.2. Trying to change others. We can’t change others unless they are willing to change. Furthermore, it takes a skilled teacher to try help someone change. You are still at the student level, please concentrate on changing yourself first.There is something called Buddhist humility. We work hard at changing ourselves first instead of trying to convert or save others.You should consider other options such as separating them: placing your mother in another home. This is more agreeable: you can frequently visit her there. I would prefer this alternative first before bringing her home especially since you have not gained your wife’s consent.To try to resolve their mutual enmity is quite difficult. I am afraid I cannot give you a good answer through this medium.In brief, I applaud your good intentions. At this stage of your cultivation, you cannot meddle in others’ affairs yet.

It’s no big deal because it’s never an end goal. We practice to unfold our true wisdom, not for little skills like that.​If you are greedy for the insignificant, how can you ever get the “big prize”?  Question (follow up):By my understanding, opening the third eye is no insignificant matter. I have heard from multiple sources that when it is opened, one no longer needs to charge up spiritual energy by focusing on the lower dan tien etc., because it is automatically charged by the third eye, a direct link into the universal energy.​No big deal, little skills, greedy, insignificant. That is not what I’m talking about. To open this third spiritual center, the upper dan tian, is to acquire the ability to live and breathe truth through direct perception of the energetic nature of things. Seeing auras, seeing the internal organs, seeing the link between man and universe clearly and undeniably. No more faith or belief is necessary, it is replaced with clear understanding.

It is not uncommon that such decisions were made under desperate conditions.Aborted children generally fall into the ghost realms. They are angry at their mothers while at the same time they cannot let go of their love for them. That is why they stay in close proximity and often cause problems for their mothers in the form of frequent headaches or disturbances during sleep or severe depression. This is what some of my disciples who have had abortions have reported to me.I will give you the same advice that I gave them:Please request rebirth plaques for your aborted children at a competent Mahayana Buddhist temple.Our experience indicates that in time the aborted children will eventually have enough blessings to be liberated from their suffering and will be reborn to the Western Bliss Pure Land. Once there they will no longer suffer and they will be grateful to you.

Is that right?      ﻿Answer:Oh dear!​Can you cover up the Buddha’s eyes when changing clothes?  Question: (follow-up)​How can I cover up the Buddha’s eyes?  Answer:It’s rather difficult to explain. Actually, there’s no problem. The Buddha does not mind at all. Whether you wear clothes or not, it’s all the same to the Buddha.​However, traditionally it’s a good idea to remove the pendant before entering impure places like bathrooms, etc. out of respect. But remember to put it on again lest you lose the pendant."},{"title":"Too Much False Thinking","content":"Question:Emituofo;I wish you good health and much bliss.I used to be Christian until a good knowing adviser suggested that I try Buddhism.My life is full of upheavals but I feel that Pure Land Buddhism is very conceivable and very beneficial.I feel like leaving the home life but people would talk me out of it and inside my mind is full of hesitation, perhaps because I still have a lot of karmic debts.When I participated in a Guan Yin recitation week, I would feel compelled to leave and go home.What should I do?Thank you very much.​                      QD      Answer:You found the right path but should seek a better guide.In order to get a great Good Knowing Adviser, you need to plant a lot of blessings just like one must pay more for a better degree from a superior university.​Therefore if I were you, I would concentrate on going to a Mahayana temple to do volunteer work and to make offerings to plant these blessings. In time, because of your sincere effort, you will come across an appropriate Good Knowing Adviser who will be able to guide you.

I won’t be enlightened doing 30 minutes a day. My mind is full of delusions. The only hope is Other Power Amitabha and Boddhisatvas. ​I want to go to Sukhavati, become a bodhisatva and come back to save beings. What do I practice in the morning and night ?Thank you,​W – Brazil      Answer:This is not a question that can be thoroughly answered in the Q&A section because of its vagueness but I will try.It seems to me that you have read up on the Pure Land Buddha Dharma.​I advise you to choose your sources carefully. For example, there are naysayers as well as blind devotees whose writings are available on the Internet but they are not credible authorities. You are better off consulting reliable sources such as the Buddhist Patriarchs. In particular, I would like to recommend literature written by my late master, Great Master Xuan Hua. His writings are available through the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association website. There is a wealth of accurate and useful information that you can trust.Furthermore, I need to caution you on teachers or people who claim that it is very easy to attain rebirth to the Pure Land: experience from teaching these last several years has proved to me otherwise.In short, you need to get proper information and learn under the guidance of a good teacher. Again stick to those who are near the main branch of Orthodox Buddhism because like most people, it will be difficult to discern right from wrong teachings.If you are able to, I strongly urge you to come and attend our Buddha recitation week to learn about the Pure Land principles and how to recite the Buddha’s name properly. It is best to make this smart initial investment that will pay off handsomely down the road.​Best wishes."},{"title":"15 minutes Lunch part 2","content":"Question:Ven. Master,阿彌陀佛. Thank you very much for your reply. I’m sorry I forgot to mention that when I visited Po Lin Monastery they were indeed having their very long Chan Qi which lasted for 70 days (ten weeks), though not everyone there participated. ​I don’t know whether they eat so quickly at other times, but since you said there is no need to train for it I’ll just leave this matter aside. I think what you said about US people being “more self-indulgent and impatient” is very very true. As I was used to the American city life, it took me a lot of efforts to learn the rules and conventions of Hong Kong Buddhist temples/centers (and I’m still learning them). I feel that this helps me grow in maturity.Bows in Respect,​MH      Answer:You are very perceptive and seem to have great affinity with Chan.The Chan Qi is one of the most wonderful Dharma Doors in Mahayana. It is a shame that Pao Lin is no longer doing 100-day Chan Qis. Maybe we’ll have to restore this wonderful Dharma in the US in order to help people become enlightened quicker.You should use the opportunity to train by taking part in their Chan Qis. Come for a day or day on the weekend. Gradually increase the number of days.After you can do three or four full days, you should consider coming to Lu Mountain temple to participate in our Chan Qis for seven days. You’ll make a lot of progress.​Bliss in the Dharma."},{"title":"Too Many Karmas","content":"Question:Praise to our fundamental teacher Shakyamuni Buddha,Please kindly clarify the following:– We create karma with our thoughts, speech and action. Must these become habit energies first before we create karma?– Suppose that we are on our 100th lifetime. Does it mean that we are subject to the karma created the prior 99 lifetimes? Going backwards, how did it all get started?– Do we cultivate in order to realize the true self which is un-produced and un-perishing? If our self is unproduced and un-extinguished, what revolves in the Reincarnation Wheel?I have been pondering about the above issues. Please kindly clarify them for me.Emituofo!​NVL      Answer:Briefly:– Giving rise to a thought immediately creates karma.– Karma has been in existence since beginningless time. You simply do not have enough time this lifetime to examine them all. It is far more productive to spend time to meditate, recite sutras, recite the Buddha’s name etc…– The (false) self revolves in the Reincarnation Wheel. The True Self is unproduced and therefore is not subject to the Wheel.Unlike the worldly knowledge which can be self-taught, Buddhism requires a knowledgeable teacher who can help you uncover your inherent wisdom through cultivation."},{"title":"Silently recite Buddha’s name","content":"Question:Ven.

I feel abandoned because my mother has her own separate family as does my father. I feel like an outcast living on the fringe of society.Could you please tell me which temple I should go to practice and learn?​THN      Answer:I am sorry you feel so bad. You need to address this issue immediately or else it could quickly develop into depression unless it has already happened. Depression is a very dangerous mental illness that has no real cure and tends not to get better over time.In my humble opinion, happiness is in finding fulfillment in life rather than in being loved. Case in point, you depended on your parents love and became very unhappy because you are no longer the primary object of their love.Finally, I do not feel that you are ready to leave the home life. Believe it or not, left home people have ideals that run fiercely in their veins. You should commit to learn more about Mahayana as it will help you feel a lot better and bring more meaning to your life.I believe that one should leave the home life to follow a very wise teacher who has mastered Mahayana. It’s the master who you should seek, not the temple. When you do find such a great teacher, be prepared to drop everything to start a new path toward ultimate fulfillment.​Best wishes."},{"title":"49 Days to Christian","content":"Question:Hi:I am a devout Christian.My mother recently passed away and I am very interested in your Buddhist concept of the 49-day period.What can I do to help my dear mother who wishes to go near God?​EAD ​      Answer:My condolences!The 49-day period is what we Buddhists are taught about what happens to most people after death.During this 49-day period, you can help my mother’s cause of obtaining a better life by drawing near your God and making donations on her behalf.

Think about it: You sit there and really do “nothing” and yet people come and cook and clean for you, offer incense, money, and so forth. Clearly, that must be due to accruing blessings beforehand.​Therefore, you should come to the temple and generate a lot of blessings to accomplish your goal: volunteer your time there, make offerings, learn to meditate, bow repentances, etc.Your family’s obstructions are also a test of your sincerity.

It is a private matter between our teachers and ourselves. For you to even think of asking reflects your lack of understanding, your lack of respect for Buddhism, and a certain level of arrogance.​I teach because my teacher told me to do so.

Hang Dat is also a disciple of Great Master Xuan Hua, what Dharma Door is he teaching? ​Ven. Master, please instruct me which Dharma Door I should learn.      Answer:I sympathize with his frustrations about the different teaching approaches of the various disciples of Great Master Xuan Hua.Unfortunately, I am unqualified to comply to his request because I have no time to look at other temples’ teaching approaches. I am primarily interested in teaching my followers what they can absorb in order to end their suffering and attain bliss.​He should take the time to investigate and compare the various approaches:If they are not consistent with Master Xua Hua’s teachings then he should distance himself from such a teacher.Furthermore, the results should speak for themselves. He should stick to an approach that works for him, that helps speed him along toward Buddhahood. After all, isn’t that what matters?”"},{"title":"Should I become a doctor","content":"Question:Ven. Master,Since doctors cure illness, do they interfere with their patients’ retributions? If so, are there any adverse consequences? ​​My life is at a crossroad now. I am not sure whether or not to go into medicine as a profession. While I would like to be able to help others, I am also concerned that it might have adverse effects on my cultivation. I asked many people about it and I was told that there are no adverse retributions because there is no interfering with others’ retributions. ​      However, those who believe that there are karmic consequences would say that I am being selfish and ignorant about Buddhism because the true Buddhist would not hesitate to help others. They would point out that how could we not be willing to help the poor and needy (seeing others getting sick and not help?)Honestly, I am very confused about the matter. Will you kindly please clarify it for me?I read a few of your Dharma talks and found them to be very useful and remarkable. I really would like to get your Chan Handbook but could not yet afford it because I am a student. I have been cultivating in secret because my parents are against it. I do realize that to cultivate the Proper Dharma requires a lot of sincerity: I will have to try even harder.I wish you good health and much progress on your cultivation path! Please forgive my afflictions.​NVV  Answer:Yes, doctors do create offenses by healing others. One must pay a price for meddling into others’ karmic retributions. In fact, doctors do end up shouldering their patients’ karmic burdens. Such is the law of cause and effect.All professions entail creating karmic offenses of one kind or another!Regardless, you should choose a profession that you are passionate about. The true Buddhist would never hesitate to go into medicine because of fearing karmic consequences. There is a price to pay for doing good: that is the way of the Mahayana Buddhists.​Should you choose to become a doctor, you can go to the temple and learn Dharmas that can help provide protection and mitigate the karmic consequences of your profession. For example, doctors should recite the Medicine Master Mantra or Great Compassion Mantra."},{"title":"Only Wish to Recite Buddha Name","content":"Question:Ven.

For example, do that while driving to work: that will naturally help you get more exposure to Mahayana while minimizing for your false thinking. In particular, you should listen to all of my late teacher’s Dharma Talks audio files because they are very insightful.Make sure to dedicate the merit and virtue of your daily cultivation as per the following link to our web site.If you do the above, you will eventually enjoy bowing and reciting the Buddha’s name a lot more.

In that case, if I were to maintain the Great Compassion Mantra alone, what effect would it have?Could you please explain how I should maintain the Mantra?​DVH      ​Answer:You should start first by reciting the Great Compassion Mantra. That will help you accrue blessings. When you have enough merit and virtue, conditions will arise to help you receive transmission for the Hands & Eyes Dharma.The proper foundation for the Great Compassion Mantra Dharma is to become a vegetarian and keep the Five Precepts.Do not lie or else you will not be able to practice the Hands & Eyes Dharma.​It is best to seek a Good Knowing Adviser in order to receive the proper guidance and protection when it comes to practicing Tantric Dharmas."},{"title":"Recitation Machine","content":"Question:Ven.

How does that affect my chances of rebirth?– When I recite the Buddha’s name, my mind feels cool and refreshed and I often feel a rush. Is that state actually the Buddha and Bodhisattvas’ help as described in the sutras? However, some CDs say that such state is the result of being touched by yin beings…Please explain for my sake in order for me to stop worrying and having doubts!Finally, I wish you health and bliss so that you can quickly realize the Way!Emituofo​HNT​      Answer:Leaving the recitation machine on at night is a good thing. It will continue to plant recitation seeds in your psyche. Of course they are not the same because while you are awake, the recitation seeds have more samadhi power by nature.The more you recite the Buddha’s name, the more rebirth blessings you have.The key is not necessarily the quantity but quality of your recitation. Therefore, when you concentrate more on your recitation, the rebirth blessings are far greater. This is why, when we train our students on the Pure Land Dharma Door, we stress developing the Buddha recitation samadhi through the proper technique.Instead of consulting the various resources indiscriminately, you should instead pick and choose the proper Pure Land authority. I personally would not waste time with materials unless it is from a Buddhist Patriarch.​For example, your CD source regarding the yin being is totally wrong. I would discard all materials from such a source."},{"title":"Not being able to sit in full lotus","content":"Question:I have tried sitting in full lotus and it helps in my practice.However, I have a problem now as I prefer sitting cross-legged (not necessary full lotus), or with my legs bend whenever I sit down. ​​Over years, and feel the blood flow in my legs is not as good as before, the condition may not be reversible. Hence I am concern with sitting in full lotus during practice even though I would really prefer to do so.Could you give any advice on what I should do so I can sit in full lotus during practice and not develop leg problems in the future?Thank you.​RJ      Answer:Twenty years ago when I first started, I saw a Hinayana monk who was 84 years old sit in full lotus and his legs looked like spaghetti. He later lived until over ninety years old and never wavered.In your case, if it is only a blood circulation concern around your knee, I would not worry too much. It is probably because you have never really tried to sit through the discomfort until your Qi is strong enough to break through the bend around the knee.The secret in the full lotus position is to initially make it difficult for the blood to flow through the bend of the knee, thereby forcing your Qi to increase to resolve the issue.​Please understand that I am not qualified to give medical advice and that all of my students of all ages have successfully been practicing sitting meditation. Not all of them can sit in full lotus and yet they continue to make progress regularly.In brief, I would like to recommend the following:If possible, practice meditation under supervision: with someone who can sit in full lotus and who has successfully led others to sit in full lotus. The skilled meditation teacher will be able to give you the proper guidance.If you can’t find such a teacher, I would follow the two minute increment guideline that I suggested in our “Chan Handbook: The Learner’s Guide to Meditation” in order to break through the leg discomfort. Going through that self-training will improve your focus. If you still feel reluctant, try smaller increments such as one-minute increments.Another avenue to consider is to come to our Chan retreats that are offered twice a year in Rosemead, California. Your meditation skills will systematically improve and you will be taught how to train yourself to take advantage of the full lotus position to keep your body fresher and younger in spite of the years.Finally, if you are truly reluctant to train yourself to sit in full lotus properly, then sit in half lotus or in the comfortable position. It is still very good to maintain a regular daily meditation schedule.I wish you the best of luck and much bliss in your meditation practice."},{"title":"Wife Wants Oral Sex","content":"Question:Ven.

I have yet to give her my consent but she has dropped hints that she would definitely get satisfaction elsewhere if she is left unsatisfied. ​May I ask: Is it OK to have oral sex with one’s wife? The reason I ask is because we already have children and to divorce would not be good karma either.​NVC      Answer:Having oral sex with one’s spouse is not an offense.However, I fear that your marriage will not last if she insists on getting [“more”] satisfaction. Why? With such an attitude, she will most likely seek [“more”] satisfaction whether or not you cooperate. Having such a strong attachment to sexual gratification will make it hard not to experiment with other partners.​I hope it works out for you."},{"title":"Silently recite Buddha’s name","content":"Question: Ven.

Often while I eat meat and fish I would recite his name: am I committing offenses? My question is if I recite the Buddha’s name but I am not a vegetarian, would I be committing offenses?I hope that you would kindly instruct me.​NTL      Answer:Thank you for sharing your concerns with us.You are doing just fine by reciting the Buddha’s name whenever you can during the day. It would be more beneficial to recite his name with utmost respect and faith because his name represents the kindest and most wholesome thought that your mind can formulate.There is no offense in reciting the Buddha’s name while eating. After you become more adept at it, you will naturally lose desire for meat and fish because your mind will become more compassionate and pure."},{"title":"Practicing Immortality Dharma","content":"Question:Emituofo:Do you know anything about immortality dharmas?Can Buddhist disciples practice such dharmas?

Now, as I look back, I realize that some of such practices are quite effective. I also felt very lucky that I chose to practice the Buddhist Dharmas instead of theirs.You should not practice such dharmas for two major reasons:​When you took refuge with the Triple Jewel, you made the vow not to draw near “externalist dharmas”. This is not because the Triple Jewel feels threatened by them. It is only because their dharmas are not ultimate: they will not help you attain liberation.I believe that the Buddhist Dharmas are so much more effective than theirs. For example, you can get far greater results more quickly if you practice Chan under a Good Knowing Adviser."},{"title":"Difficulties in maintaining Shurangama Mantra","content":"Question:Emituofo,I would really appreciate your kind guidance.I realize that I have a lot of greedy desires and therefore I resolved to recite the Shurangama Mantra [not clear…]. ​​However, after each time that I recite the Mantra I often have unwholesome thoughts whereas when I do not recite the Mantra, my mind would be normal: not that it is free from greedy desires but rather it is not as heavy and uncomfortable as when I recite.Please teach me what to do. Thank you.​HD      ​Answer:You have great blessings for having the ability to maintain the Shurangama Mantra.What you are experiencing is called karmic obstructions.The Vietnamese have a saying: “The ten thousand undertakings are very hard to kick-start.” It takes time and patience before you can get your momentum.​Just patiently endure the discomfort.

I really fail to understand; why that would happen?Please kindly explain this to me.Respectfully,​NTB      Answer:This seems to bother you more than your parents, or else they would have stopped giving away the medicine. Perhaps it is because the majority of the recipients are grateful?If you take the time to delve deeper into Buddhism, you would understand:​To help others means that one must be prepared to pay the consequences, including being criticized or encountering ingratitude. For example, I advise my left-home students to quit if they expect rewards or recognition: no good deed goes unpunished!You should open up your heart and welcome criticism.

My husband is much older than me.Please kindly tell me what to do?Emituofo!Thank you very much.​NTTT      Answer:It is a good thing that your husband allowed you to set up an altar at home.You should take advantage of it and bow to the Buddha for an hour every day. Make time for it. You will eventually find that the bowing time makes up for increased peace of mind and well-being.Then you should go to the temple and request to be taught how to recite the Buddha’s name. You can do this all day without going to the temple, while doing the household chores.Whenever you have the chance, go to the temple and create more merit and virtue: recite sutras, bow repentances, recite the Buddha’s name, volunteer your time and make offerings.When your husband scolds you, you should bow more sincerely at the altar and repent for your past offenses toward him that causes him to be mean to you.​If you wish to attain rebirth to the Pure Land this lifetime, you must recite the Buddha’s name more earnestly and create more infinite blessings with the Triple Jewel."},{"title":"Reciting the Infinite Life Sutra","content":"Question:Ven. Master,I worship Shakyamuni Buddha. Is it OK for me to recite the Infinite Life Sutra? Please clarify this for me.Emituofo,​VTH      Answer:Shakyamuni Buddha spoke of the Infinite Life Sutra so that we can recite and maintain it. Your reciting the Sutra shows obedience and loyalty to Shakyamuni Buddha.​Better yet, consider rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land by cultivating the Pure Land Dharma Door in earnest. It will make Shakyamuni Buddha very happy."},{"title":"Recitation Dharma Doors","content":"Question:Ven. Master,First, allow me to say that my sister and I are very grateful that you took time of your busy schedule to talk to us for so long. ​​Unfortunately, we had an engagement with our family or else we would have loved to ask you to clarify a lot more things for us. Please kindly clarify the following for us:1. In your Chan Handbook, you transmitted the Buddha Recitation Dharma Door to the readers. Can we use the same methodology to recite mantras?2. When we Use the Guan Yin Dharma Door (Contemplating the Sounds Method), do we contemplate both the sound and the Dan Tian. Would that not create distractions [the mind being split between two tasks]?3. In the Handbook, you indicated that the Shurangama Mantra is the most powerful. Should I memorize it in Vietnamese, Chinese or English? If I do not have the time, is it OK to just recite the heart of the Shurangama Mantra?​I hope that we will have the opportunity to participate in the temple’s Fo Qi (Buddha Recitation Week) or Chan Qi in the future.We wish you good health, peace and bliss, blessings and wisdom in abundance and success in the Buddha’s work.Respectfully,TD        Answer:Thank you for coming from so far to visit our temple.1. Yes, you can use the Buddha’s Name Recitation methodology for all recitation practices, including mantras.2. The Guan Yin Dharma Door is an exception. You can forget about the Dan Tian, just concentrate on the sound of your recitation.​3. You can memorize the Shurangama Mantra in the language of your choosing. What is more important is the accuracy of the mantra version in the specific language. It would be most excellent if you could recite it from memory every day. It took me five weeks to memorize the Chinese version. I heard of a Vietnamese who memorized it in ten days!​Recite the Heart of the Shurangama Mantra 108 times each day too, if possible."},{"title":"Summer Chan Qi Feedback","content":"Question:Dear Master,First of all, I would like to pay my respects to you in thanks for organizing the Chan Qi retreat for us. During the one month I stayed at Lu Mountain Temple, it felt like I was living in a small version of the Mahayana Pure Land and that you were the Cardinal who with altruism saved living beings by teaching us the meditation dharma.​Lu Mountain Temple is a calm, relaxing, dignified place, and very suitable for meditation. While there, I learned a lot of meaningful things: Spiritual cultivation practice is the best daily activity; we should have no fear of suffering (that is, we should be willing to accept the suffering and have patience to bear it when most people do not); and do not be satisfied with what we have achieved. You have taught us that we should not waste our samadhi energy with false thoughts. This energy which is on a higher plane is unconditional but it is lost when we think false thoughts because they are conditional.      Currently, I do not have any difficulty in sitting while meditating. Each day, I meditate for 2 hours and my experience is exciting, pleasant:– In the morning (1 hour): sitting in full lotus, reciting Shurangama Sutra and the Buddha’s name.– In the evening (1 hour): sitting in full lotus, reciting the Buddha name, the Great Compassion Sutra, and the Ten Small Sutras.While sitting, I am thoughtful: I inhale and exhale from the navel. I feel so comfortable and pleasant.Now, I sincerely request that you teach me more. At this point, what and how should I practice? Many thanks to you, Master.Sincerely,​TA  ​​Answer:Toward the last week, your blessings were falling short.It is hard to continue making progress when blessings are inadequate.​Therefore you should actively create more blessings. Create great merit and virtue and you will get great benefits."},{"title":"Reducing creation of karmas","content":"Question:Greetings Venerable Master,I came across your website while searching for the teachings of Venerable Master Xuan Hua, and I had the luck of finding the Q&A section. ​​I’d like to say in advance that I am sorry if I may sound rude or offensive. I do not consider myself to be a Buddhist but I greatly admire Buddhist teachings; they sound right in my heart. I also admire the resolve of left-home people to cultivate in order to help all living beings. I already learned a lot from the Q&As, but I have some questions I was hoping that you may clarify:        – How should one transfer blessings?– How should one practice repentance?– I have the sutra texts in my iPad. Whenever I am reading them I try to treat them according to some rules that I have found on the internet (put the texts on a high place, never read lying down, etc.), but when I am not reading the sutras, I treat the iPad as a normal object. Is this ok, or I should abide by the rules since the sutras are in the iPad even when I’m not reading them?– I am studying acupuncture. I have read about on how a healer gets some of the debt of the patients in the article in your site. I enjoy helping people but the Buddhist solution of creating affinity with both sides seems the best. Is there anything I could to, such as transfer blessings to patients and to whoever is causing the illness, to improve my healing abilities?– I practice Shaolin Kung Fu, Qi Gong and meditation every day, which I treasure even more since I learned that the Patriarch of these arts is the Venerable Bodhidharma. I also had the good fortune to find a genuine master. I find that these arts make me a better person. Is this an appropriate Dharma-door for cultivation, or is it preferable just to focus on Chan meditation and Pure land?– I like to read about the Buddhist sutras, especially Master Xuan Hua’s comments. I also enjoy very much sharing what I learn, but I try hard to not create offenses by sharing my own false views and encourage people to read by their own instead of just trusting my word. Should I continue to do this, or is it better for me not to share my own views?​– I bought a Buddhist wrist mala when I was traveling in Malaysia.Recently, I was cooking and burned my hand, which made me punch the wall in anger. I broke two beads on my bracelet, and I’m keeping the bracelet to remind me that anger can cause one to harm the things I appreciate. Is this OK?Please forgive me for asking so many questions, and feel free to ignore some or all of them. Thank you [for] taking the time with your Q&A.Respectfully,MP, Portugal  Answer:I apologize for the tardiness in replying to you. We went off-line for a month during our last Summer Chan Qi in June.To transfer blessings is to give them specifically to designated recipients. Since you are not Buddhist, I will teach you a superior non-Buddhist format: At the end of the day, you can dedicate the blessings you have created from your acts of goodness to all living beings hoping that they will attain Ultimate Goodness.In order to repent, I feel that the best way is the Buddhist approach. Why? Because the Buddhists repent in two aspects: 1. They publicly admit that they are wrong. 2. They resolve not to commit that karma or offense again. And finally they seek help in erasing their offenses (karmas). In other words, they find someone (a Buddhist monk) who can actually help erase their karmas.In your case, I would recommend that you bow to Shakyamuni Buddha with sincerity. To show your sincerity you must bow for a long time: by that I mean bow continuously for half an hour a day. If you are sincere, the Buddha will erase your karmas. You can tell that your karmas have been erased because you will experience strange things like heavenly fragrance, bright lights shining upon you, visions of the Buddhas and so forth.Your handling of the iPad is correct.As to your acupuncture work, you create good deeds by helping others but you are meddling. In other words, you are upsetting a lot of beings responsible for your patients’ illnesses. It’s just life: there are always pros and cons. When you take Buddhism more seriously, we can teach you more effective ways to help both sides. I hope that you can find other approaches that are more suitable to your desire to remain independent.If you have found a good master then stick with him. When you have found a real good monk who can truly teach you Chan and Pure Land, then you will naturally want to switch because you will get a lot more out of your Buddhist practice. For instance, I had a few Chan students who practiced yoga, Qi Gong, Tai Ji and so forth. After they started practicing Chan, they made so much more progress that they quickly dropped those other practices.It is good to share goodness but it is not good to share goodness when you are not asked. That is not sharing: that is imposing your views on others.No problem with your handling of the mala bracelet incident. However, there seems to be a problem with your temper. If I were your martial arts teacher, I would help you work on controlling your temper before resuming marital arts training. Without discipline, your temper might cause more harm!​Thank you for your questions."},{"title":"Neglecting Husband","content":"Question:Emituofo.We already have two children but my husband still prefers to spend time with his friends, drinking among other things. I want to convince my husband to walk the Buddha path with me but am not sure what I should do. ​I often recite the Buddha’s name and repent, hoping that my husband will quickly change his ways. I also pray that the Buddha will awaken my husband: but is it too greedy of my part?Please kindly instruct me.PSD        Answer:You may want to take advantage of your husband outside interests to come to the temple and learn how to cultivate. Save yourself first instead of trying to save or change him. If you can’t save yourself, you certainly cannot have any really significant influence on him.​The Buddha cannot save your husband. He has to help himself. One cannot attain liberation unless one cultivates. Even the Buddha cannot cultivate for any of us."},{"title":"How to make vows","content":"Question:Ven. Master,Please teach me how to make vows.Thank you very much.​MT ​      Answer:When on one’s own, vows can be made with utmost sincerity in front of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. However, vows made under the guidance of a Good Knowing Adviser will be done more correctly, because he or she who can advise you as to what kind of vows are appropriate. He or she can then guide you as to how to execute them in order to perfect this Paramita.​In general, I would not hesitate to make the vow to pay any price to find a Good Knowing Adviser from whom to learn Mahayana. Then I would then spare no expense or effort to go visit him or her for instruction. If we are really sincere, we will definitely be taught."},{"title":"Touched by Master","content":"Question:Na Mo Fundamental Teacher Shakyamuni Buddha:Please kindly instruct me!It hurts me deeply to talk about this.One day, a monk that I really admired the most embraced me. As I was still stupefied, he asked me whether or not I was attracted to him. I immediately answered that I was not. He instantly apologized to me. Afterward, I thought about it and told myself that I was not interested in him and yet he chose to embrace the dust and he was not actually embracing my body.Ven. Master, is my thinking correct? Or am I just fooling myself?Thank you for your help​LHM      Answer:I am very sorry about your unfortunate experience with your spiritual teacher.As an apology, I ask for your forgiveness for the shortcomings of my fellow monks and nuns. We are trying to work on ending our sexual desires. As such, many of us are still struggling quite a bit with it.Having said that, it was most inappropriate for that monk to make unsolicited advances toward you.Again, I share in your pain.You have two choices:Report it to the abbot. It would help that young monk in the long run in that it forced him to face his strong desires and decide whether or not the spiritual path is for him.Leave the temple if the abbot does not side with you and protect you from slander or criticism. This is beneficial to you because you are pursuing the path of truthfulness."},{"title":"Returning to Lay Life","content":"Question:Ven. Master,I know of someone who left the home life a long time ago.Recently, that person is considering returning to lay life: would that involve committing offenses?​TTMH      Answer:If the left home life style is not suitable, it is better to return to lay life.​In general, we can return to lay life anytime instead of violating the precepts and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas would not hold it against us."},{"title":"What is Pure Land","content":"Question:Ven. Master,What is the Pure Land Dharma Door?​LBN      Answer:The Pure Land adherents:Believe that going to the Western Bliss Pure Land is their quickest and most suitable option to attain liberation.Therefore they sincerely make the vow to be reborn there.They then engage in the various practices such as reciting sutras, reciting the Buddha’s name, bowing to the Buddha, maintaining mantras etc… to create rebirth blessings."},{"title":"Rebellious Daughter","content":"Question:Ven. Master,I feel miserable because my daughter will not listen to me even though she is only in the sixth grade. She is twelve years old. What am I to do?Emituofo,​Buddhist disciple TH      Answer:I see two problems:Children often learn from their mistakes. Instead of getting afflicted from her being rebellious, you should instead resign yourself to telling her in advance that she is headed toward trouble and that her actions will have the opposite effect that she is wishing. If you are correct, then she will be more inclined to believe you in the future. Remember, you should be cool-headed instead of getting afflicted when she does not listen to you. It does not hurt to find out who she has faith in or respects and ask that person for help.​Furthermore, perhaps you are getting afflicted because you are afraid that you cannot handle it when she really gets into trouble. That’s the retribution for all parents. You could go the spiritual route and create blessings for her so that she will not get into trouble. Furthermore, resolve to be a role model of virtue for her by becoming more pious. You are responsible for instilling virtues in her. Therefore, you should become more virtuous! If you are sincere in this approach, she will be impressed by your actions and then she will naturally follow suit."},{"title":"Stomach Growls When Meditating","content":"Question:Ven. Master,I have been contemplating my breath as per your instruction. I need further direction because I think ran into some problems:I inhale and expand my tummy, hold my breath for 2-5 seconds and then exhale. Often when I hold my breath, my stomach starts making bubbling noises even as air comes out from my mouth. While I contemplate my breath, I feel very comfortable. If I prevent the air from escaping then I feel a little bit of discomfort. Also, I pass gas while I meditate but I still feel as comfortable as before.Is there anything wrong with my practice? Please clarify it for me. After I started following your meditation methodology, I feel better and can sleep better. For that I am very grateful and wish you great health.Respectfully,​TA      Answer:For the past few weeks, you have been working hard, following the instructions of our Chan Handbook.You indicated that you have meditated for years and that you had not yet experienced the above-described states; is that correct?

Master:I was born into an area where Buddhism was obstructed and could not thrive. Thus, when those to whom I introduced Buddhism obtained great results, I became blissfully happy.In time, I came to realize my path to leave the home life and return to my area try to propagate the Proper Dharma.Unfortunately, due to my mistakes, while I was preparing for my university examinations, I could not practice that much and could only recite the Buddha’s name in a very limited way. And now I have a change of heart about leaving the home life, and love and desire well up inside of me. This is the biggest reason for my hesitation. I read Master XuanHua’s biography and used what I learned from it to not indulge in worldly pleasures. But my greed for love is extremely overwhelming. Please kindly assist me.​HS        Answer:I commend you for your great resolve to leave the home life. Not only is it most worthwhile as an aspiration, your mindset on helping others is also very remarkable. That is the mindset for Mahayana practitioners.Your experience is the same as most all of us left-home people. Once you bring the resolve to leave the home life, the tests come fast and furious. In particular, the test of love and desire can be overwhelming.There is nothing to worry about. Many of us who faced these same tests have overcome them by doing the following:Choose the proper environment. After you have come to the pure or sagely grounds of the temples, your desires will naturally lessen.Choose the proper method of practice. If you practice under the guidance of the proper teacher, you will be able to quickly defeat your selfish desires.Most importantly, you must find the temple which teaches the Proper Dharma. Isn’t it extremely critical that you first learn the Dharma and certify to it before you teach others?In brief, if I were you, I would not be alarmed at all. I would patiently endure the tests while actively seeking for a competent teacher. Simply visit Mahayana temples because that is where the Proper Dharma is being taught. Go there and observe carefully. Better yet, go stay on the temple grounds for a week or so and open your eyes. Do left-home people engage in activities that encourage sexual desires? If they do, then run away as quickly as possible. As to the remaining temples, I would only consider temples that are practicing the Dharma of a bona fide Mahayana Patriarch. If they fail to recognize or identify their own teachers then they certainly have not achieved certification of the Proper Dharma.Until you have found your Good Knowing Adviser, you should be reciting the Heart Sutra when desires arise.​Best wishes to you."},{"title":"Bad Monk","content":"Question:Namo Emituofo.Ven. Master,I am a Buddhist disciple living in Da Nang [Vietnam].​I have always believed in the power of reciting “Emituofo” and especially in lofty and revered sanghans. Please help me discern whether what I am about to ask you could arise from my stupidity or from my loss of faith in Buddhism.      Ven. Master, I have a girlfriend and we love each other very much. One day, she told me that two years ago, she slept with a monk by the name of T who resides at **** Temple (forgive me for not revealing the temple name). I was very shocked and asked her for more details but she would not give, saying repeatedly that Ven. T took the initiative by asking for her phone number and courted her. When he went her out, he wore civilian clothes and ate meat. Afterwards, the both of them had sex. He then gave her 300.000 Vietnamese piasters. He even confided to her that he would eat meat every two months.Ven. Master, I really lost faith in people and Buddhism. If Buddhism is so wonderful, is it possible that it would tolerate such deplorable behavior from its own sanghans? Can such odious people accomplish the Buddha Way?Namo Emituofo, please help me understand.​NN  Answer:I can understand how horribly betrayed you would feel.Of course, monk T’s behavior is not condoned by the sangha in any way. The fact is that his remaining a monk and continued lewd behavior is very detrimental to his temple and Buddhism at large. That is how the demons are destroying Vietnamese Buddhism in your area: they do it from within, by enlisting the aid of such fake monks.Once you have recovered from your pains and disappointments at your girlfriend, you should reconsider: is it fair to blame Buddhism for the bad behaviors of a few bad apples? These evil individuals will definitely fall to the Avici Hells where they will suffer for countless kalpas: that is what is waiting for them.As to your losing faith in Buddhism, let me ask you this: Suppose you lost a finger, does that mean that you cut off your hand because it is no longer perfect? If that temple still harbors that monk, then go to another temple!I hope that you will quickly recover from your great disappointments for something that happened long ago. Then you should learn to behave like a superior man by forgiving your girlfriend for her past mistakes or if you cannot then get another one. Also, learn to forgive yourself for living in the past and your propensity to blame others for your pains. Such is the behavior of the better Buddhist disciples."},{"title":"What about Fa Lun Gong","content":"Questions:Ven. Master,What do you think about the Fa Lun Gong?Thank you.​MTV      Answer:From the Buddhist perspective, the Fa Lun Gong dharma is considered be externalist because it fails to help people obtain True Liberation.The true Buddhist seeks real wisdom and not short term gains or responses.Truthfully speaking, they have a lot of followers because a lot of people benefited from it. Personally,I feel that for the same investment of time and efforts in learning from a Good Knowing Adviser, the Buddhists will very quickly obtain far greater benefits."},{"title":"Preparing for Rebirth","content":"Question:Ven. Master,I am very happy that you returned safely from your trip to Asia to take care of the temple matters.​I recently spent a lot of time to listen your Dharma Talks from your web site repeatedly. As a result, it has helped restore my original faith and respect you. The eight winds blew and yet you were unperturbed and at ease, whereas your disciple’s mind was deeply moved. My gongfu is still quite inadequate [even after decades of vigorous practice]! Once again, please accept my sincere apologies [for doubting you].      Next, I would like to report an important matter:The first week of April 2013, toward daybreak, I was in a state of half asleep and half awake and heard someone whisper in my ears: “You should stop chasing after things [this person leads a large group of Pure Land practitioners]. Instead, you had better prepare to go home next year”.I interpreted the dream as an omen that I will have the chance to be with the Buddha next year. Instead of being fearful, I felt very blissful and at peace. I became very enthused [with the omen] and began to drop things in order to prepare for my upcoming journey.Therefore, the first thing I feel needs to be done is to request the 49-day Dharma from you just in case that my children might not believe and would fail to do so after I am gone.Here is what I plan to do, please kindly correct me if I am wrong:1. Request the 49-day Dharma for myself (I will bring a check for offering in June when I will come to attend your Chan Qi).2. Request the 49-day Dharma for my husband (we plan to startr making donations from 7/2013 until 2/2014.)3. I have already requested for a rebirth plaque for myself. I will continue to take care of that after 2/2014.I believe that you agreed to help because I was very vigorous with my cultivation and really wished to obtain rebirth this lifetime. The majority of those who practice the Buddha Recitation Method become confused at their time of death and therefore have no choice but follow their karmic retributions [thus failing to obtain rebirth to the Pure Land]. The traditional Buddha Recitation group can help stabilize the environment [the funeral home] but are really incapable of improving the deceased’s chances for rebirth. People seem to be obstructed by the donations [for the funeral services] and fail to see the big picture [how to maximize their rebirth chances]. Ultimately, their failure [to adopt the proper approach] is only due to having inadequate blessings. Therefore, those who are wealthy [but fail to obtain rebirth this lifetime] are not blessed enough.Please forgive my wordiness. I anxiously await your reply.Emituofo.​DN  Answer:Life is but a journey. All parties must eventually end.It is very wise of you to make preparations for the eventual end. Only the privileged few people would know how to make the proper necessary steps.I do not blame all of you because the test was extremely difficult, even for myself. You can’t graduate unless you pass the difficult exams. Another way to look at it is: if the Dharma is really effective then the demons will come furiously to slander and denigrate it so as to prevent people from taking advantage of it. Ultimately, if the Dharma is for real then it will withstand the tests and attacks. Eventually, the demons will grow tired and run out of ammunitions.Regardless, I feel for your struggles because you really cared.I concur with your plans. The only thing that I would add is to help others also take advantage of this particular rebirth Dharma. As you are beginning to understand now, if you do not believe in it, I do not feel inclined to help. Faith is one most important requirement of the Rebirth Dharma. When you are truly blessed you will place your faith in the proper temple.​For people like you who wish to effectively prepare for your next journey, I advise them to continue to deepened their faith and create more rebirth blessings by helping others take advantage of it as well. Those who have great blessings will decide to get on board."},{"title":"Where is Proper Dharma","content":"Question:[Regarding a comment made about a senior monk’s Dharma]I agree with your assessment. Mahayana and Hinayana are two different paths. What are we Buddhist disciples to do? Where can we find Shakyamuni Buddha’s Proper Dharma?​QV ​      Answer:Mahayana and Hinayana are one and the same path. It is the teachers and cultivators who do not understand yet who think they are different.What are you ordinary cultivators supposed to do?That is a very good question. I’ll elaborate a little more than I normally do for your sake.You resolve to cultivate Mahayana. Hinayana is called the Half Word Teaching, meaning it is not complete. Now that you know, why would you settle for only a subset of the Buddha’s entire teaching?Those who prefer to settle for less do so because they have inadequate blessings.Therefore, you should avoid making the same mistakes as they do. Instead, look for opportunities to plant Mahayana blessings. Then relentlessly create merit and virtue with Mahayana.At the same time, seek out Mahayana teachers. In other words, you have to make the effort to go look for them. If you exhaust every avenue to seek them out, then they are more inclined to teach you when you meet with them.Once you have enough Mahayana blessings you will encounter competent Mahayana teachers."},{"title":"Erroneous Breathing Contemplation","content":"Question:Ven. Master,​I still do not understand: what is meant by “breathing naturally” and do “not interfere with the breathing?” Please give me an example and elaborate.In my limited understanding, to breathe naturally, does that mean that one does not take long or short breaths? Please kindly clarify this for me.When I am standing or sitting on a chair, I can breathe very comfortably, my breath fills up my stomach effortlessly (it takes about six seconds to fill up my stomach) and I feel very good. However, while sitting, especially in full lotus, my breathing becomes difficult. The first three seconds are OK, but afterward it does not feel comfortable, as if there is some obstruction and I experience discomfort in my stomach. When I continue to breathe, air cannot fill up my stomach as much as while I am standing or sitting in a chair. Similarly, when exhaling, the first three seconds are OK but afterward, it feels uncomfortable.      If I continue, then I feel uncomfortable after 20 minutes.Recently, I made some adjustments. As soon as it feels uncomfortable (normally after the first three seconds) I stop my breathing in and start exhaling. While exhaling and it starts feeling uncomfortable, I then start inhaling. As a result, my breathing is shallower than before. When I’m doing is this way, it feels good and I can sit longer. Is this appropriate?Furthermore, my back is not straight. While sitting, it is bent a little bit in order to make my breathing comfortable to fill up my stomach.I tried straightening out my back. Originally, air cannot reach my stomach or only one liter of air would come in. Over time, it is getting better but it still feels uncomfortable. Please help me breathe correctly.Thank you very much and I wish you good health.Respectfully,​TA  Answer:You are continuing to interfere with your breathing by “doing” all the things that you describe.If it feels uncomfortable, then be aware of it but do nothing. If the breath is shorter while sitting, then be aware of it and do nothing. If the back is bent, do not try to straighten it out, just be aware of it and it will naturally straighten itself over time.You are trying too hard. That is why I prefer to teach my students to recite the Buddha’s name and ignore their breathing. Watching your breath tends to bring out the “control freak” in all of you.If it feels uncomfortable, then bear it until it stops feeling uncomfortable. It’s just like going to the gym, at first it hurts when lifting weights, but it is necessary to build up muscle mass.I do not mind your detailed questions. It will be much clearer when you come to our temple. Also, it will be much easier to make progress. To prepare for the upcoming Chan Qi, you should concentrate on sitting for two hours.​All of you please note: The Chan Qi is supervised Chan training as per each person’s individual level. Each of you should train according to your own preferences, abilities and circumstances."},{"title":"Repenting for Deviant Sex Precept","content":"Question:Ven. Master,If I have sex with the person I love, is it a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept? If so, how do I repent for it? Please kindly instruct me.Emituofo,​HP      Answer:Yes it is a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept if you have already received the Five Precepts.It is very difficult to repent but it can be done. I am not at liberty to discuss it publicly; otherwise I would be breaking Precepts myself. Also, you cannot “retake” the Deviant Sex Precept until after your offenses have been erased.​Generally speaking, I hope that left-home people would properly train their disciples on the Precepts, their meaning and responsibilities, before transmitting the Precepts to them. I was also not trained when I received them from my Chinese teacher and simply “lucked-out,” because somehow, I avoided committing violations before I thoroughly understood the responsibilities of receiving them. Perhaps if you would also ask these questions of the left-home people at your temple, they will come to realize that they need further training to help you."},{"title":"Masturbation & False Thinking","content":"Question:Ven. Master,I have two questions:1. If a lay Buddhist disciple masturbates, is that a Precept violation? Is that repentable? Is masturbation a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept?​2. When I recite sutras, I still have a lot of false-thinking and that makes me very afflicted. Am I creating offenses because I cannot control my thoughts?Please kindly instruct me so that I can better understand Precepts.​Emituofo,JK      Answer:1. If you have not yet received the Precepts then you have not violated them. However, that being said, you still violate the “Precepts against nature,” meaning that it’s not a good thing. In the strict sense, masturbation is not a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept, but it is a violation of your inherent wisdom. Knowing that, shouldn’t you work harder at putting an end to ignorant behavior?​2. We all do. That is why we come to the temple to learn how to eliminate false-thinking. Yes, you are creating mind offenses. But you are also generating merit and virtue if you keep at it. After you learn the proper methodology, you will eventually be able to eliminate your errant thoughts and realize Non-thought."},{"title":"Helping Niece With Mental Challenges","content":"Question:Ven.

Her mind is that of a 2-year old: she cannot speak, she has no memory, and she needs help to bathe.Occasionally, she goes into a fit and destroys everything in sight. Her parents are very sad and miserable as they have taken care of her for all these years.I’ve come to realize that my brother’s family and my niece have very heavy karmic obstructions. Therefore, on my niece’s behalf, I often repent, recite sutras and recite the Great Compassion Mantra, hoping to lighten her karmic retribution.Is my thinking correct? If so, can my actions have any positive effect?Please teach me how to help diminish her karmic obstructions and to turn her toward the Triple Jewel for guidance and help.Thank you very much and I wish you good health.Respectfully,​TA      Answer:You are right in trying to alleviate your niece’s karmic retributions.Apparently, your brother and his wife owe her. They also need help.Your actions have helped to some extent, but perhaps they are not timely to have much impact. And I hope I am not offending you, but your gongfu is not that strong yet. It is like trying to chip away at a large rock with a small hammer. However, you could request help from people who are stronger than you and are trained in this kind of spiritual work.The Chinese tradition has Dharmas such as Medicine Master Buddha (look for the explanation of the Medicine Master Sutra on our web site) and Past Creditors (rebirth Dharma).​When you have the chance to come to the temple, we can give you more detail and referrals."},{"title":"Helping non-believer daughter","content":"Question:Ven. Master,​My name is HG. My Dharma name is TA. I have a daughter who came to the US in 1991 when she was 12 years old. Now she is a pharmacist who is talented but lacks virtue. She is more preoccupied with benefitting herself than helping others. She does not believe in the Buddha nor Cause and Effect. ​      Although I love her dearly, I sometimes feel very disappointed in her. I really worry about her future lives. I often recite the Great Compassion Mantra; I practice giving and then transfer the merit and virtue to her. I also repent on her behalf, praying that she will soon believe in the Triple Jewel and apply the Buddha’s teachings to her daily life in order to accrue blessings for her future lives. Am I proceeding correctly to help her? Please kindly instruct me.When we cultivate and transfer the merit and virtue for others, is there any difference?Thank you very much.Repsectfully,TAPS: If you wish, please call me at …​TA  Answer:She is talented but lacks virtue because she learned it from you. Typically, parents put so much emphasis in their children acquiring skills and tend to neglect The Way virtue.Most of you do not realize that monetary gains and social status are the result of prior blessings, not from intelligence or skills alone. The proof is in the fact that a lot of geniuses die in poverty.Your transferring merit and virtue to her and repenting on her behalf are good deeds. Gradually, you will also learn other more effective ways to help her. Most importantly, if you wish to change her then you first must change yourself by becoming more virtuous because only The Way virtue can change and transform modern people.​When you come to California to practice with us, perhaps we can elaborate more on this topic."},{"title":"Cultivate Blessing Certify Fruition","content":"Question:Can one certify to the sagely fruitions by cultivating blessings only and not practice meditation?

I would be too regarding the authenticity of your sources.Personally, I believe it because my teacher, the late Great Master Xuan Hua said so. He would not lie to me nor has he ever lied to anyone about Buddhism.Furthermore, I consult the original Buddhist Scriptures known as the Great Treasury Scriptures 大藏經. They are recognized by all Buddhist experts as the indisputable teachings of the Buddha.​After you have planted more blessings with Mahayana, you too will believe."},{"title":"Arranging Altar","content":"Question:Ven.

Master!I think I found you because of Medicine Master Buddha’s guidance! I have always recited Medicine​Master Buddha’s name albeit not that frequently! I hope that you will clarify a few things for me!!!​      1) Should I recite his name or his mantra?2) What does the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma involve? In Vietnam, there are quite a few monks who practice this Dharma. Please teach me how to cultivate it.3) My father and younger sibling seem to be harassed by yin beings. They often claim that someone has cast a voodoo spell on them. They appear to be healthy but they [sometimes] speak strangely. Once, in the middle of the night, they went off by themselves to light incense at a small stupa. They then talked to themselves, berating others etc… What can we do? There is no way to convince them to recite the Buddha’s name. Please help us!!!​BT  Answer:Greetings to you.1. You should continue to recite his name, but more frequently every day. It’s not advisable to recite his mantra because it will require much from you, including that you become vegetarian, abstain onion and garlic, and more.2. You should go and seek advice from those monks in Vietnam who practice the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma. I am not sure how they go about it. Nevertheless, I advise to start with bowing to Medicine Master Buddha every day for half an hour to an hour. You can also place the Medicine Master Sutra on the altar and make offerings to it frequently. That is how I would get started: by bowing and making offerings.3. It would appear that your father and younger sibling are possessed by yin beings, as you suspect. This is not good because the rest of your family is also exposed to possible problems. Perhaps you should ask those monks you mentioned above for help? If you were here in the US, there are competent temples that can really help that I would be able to recommend. Unfortunately, I don’t know of a temple in Vietnam to suggest. There should be, but I am not aware of any. Perhaps, if you bow, make offerings to the Sutra, and recite his name more sincerely, he’ll point you to the right one.​My best wishes!"},{"title":"Wish To Learn Chan","content":"Question:[A Buddhist disciple who is 63 years old asks:]I have been meditating for several years with little result… Thanks to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, I was able to get a hold of your book, “The Chan Handbook: The Learner’s Guide to Meditation.” ​​After reading it, I realized that you are a competent and kind Good Knowing Adviser.

If possible, go to a Mahayana temple nearby to receive instruction from a sanghan. If that is not possible, I highly recommend that you start by reading Great Master Xuan Hua’s books.

Master! I have several questions regarding Taking Refuge and the Five Precepts. Please kindly and compassionately instruct me.      1. Some time ago, I knew a nun who came from the same town as me and who resided in a meditation institute. Once during our travels, my father and I paid her a visit. She advised my father to take refuge with the Triple Jewel. At that time I was 15 years old and knew nothing about Buddhism or the meaning of Taking Refuge. She registered both of us for the refuge ceremony, but we did not attend the lecture on Taking Refuge and the Precepts. We did not attend those ceremonies either. After we returned to our hometown, she sent us the paperwork of proof of Taking Refuge, detailing our names, given Dharma names and Dharma Teacher’s name… Is this consistent with the Taking Refuge Dharma? In the future, can I attend a Taking Refuge ceremony but still keep the original Dharma name?2. After receiving the Five Precepts, if we wish to renounce any of them, what should we do? Can we kneel in front of the altar at home to do it or must we go to the temple?3. I heard of the term “masturbation.” What does that mean? Is masturbation a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept?4. Is sexual intercourse before marriage a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept?5. I read on the internet that a monk explained: “if one has sexual intercourse before marriage but both the people really love each other and have mutual consent it is not a violation of the Precepts.” Is that correct? I am very confused about this issue.6. I had sexual intercourse without premeditation with my boyfriend. Did I violate Precepts then? We met and planned to talk without intending to have sex. However, we started touching and kissing each other. My boyfriend had sexual intercourse with me against my will while I had no pleasure at all. Did I violate the Precepts?7. If we just hug, kiss and caress each other, is that a violation of the Precepts?8. If I did violate the Precepts, how do I repent? Can I bow to the Buddhas? Once the Precepts are violated, does that mean all the blessings and virtues from our prior cultivation would be lost?Can we repent and regain our purity?Thank you very much!​N  Answer:​I will try to briefly answer your questions.Your predicament illustrates a common problem in the practice of Buddhism. It happened to me as well when I was a lay person: many of us receive transmission of the Five Precepts even though we are not properly taught how to keep the Precepts.If we follow the Five Precepts properly, then we obtain tremendous benefits. Conversely, there are serious consequences if we violate them. That is why, at our temple, we do not transmit the Five Precepts until after people attend the training class. The Five Precepts is a wonderful and superior Buddhist Dharma that is designed to help you, not entrap or hurt you.In my humble opinion, in your personal case, you can consider that technically you have not taken refuge or received the Five Precepts. Why not? Because you did not understand the Precepts before taking refuge and you were not at the ceremony. Therefore the Precept substance was not properly transmitted to you or to your father. From the Mahayana perspective, we cannot hold you to something that you really did not personally make an oath to observe. There is more detail I could go into, but for the sake of brevity and clarity I have to limit my response. Dharma names are given by the Master. In general, it is up to him to decide whether or not you can keep your old Dharma name.I cannot divulge the process of renouncing the Precepts on the internet. The Precepts Dharma can only be explained to our devotees.Yes, masturbation is a minor violation of the Deviant Sex Precept. It is still repentable.Sexual intercourse before marriage is a violation of the Deviant Sex Precept.That monk is wrong. He should have consulted with the Buddhist Vinaya before explaining the Precepts. Alas, in this Dharma Ending Age, few left home people study the Precepts anymore. Left home people give inadequate, improper and wrong instructions. That is why you folks are so confused.The scenario you presented would indicate that you did violate the Deviant Sex Precept. However, according to #1, you did not “officially” violate it because you never really “officially” received it.Not in the strictest sense. However, doing so tends to lead to violation.Again, I apologize for not answering your question here because I cannot reveal the Buddhist Repentance Dharma on the internet."},{"title":"Define Ignorance","content":"Question:​Would you please do me the favor of defining ignorance as it is mentioned below:“At the center of every Wheel of Life are a cock, a snake and a pig, which represent greed, anger and ignorance. In Buddhism, greed, anger (or hate) and ignorance are called the ‘Three Poisons’.”Thank you,​DW      Answer:I am not sure where you got your quote but it is rather amusing.The cock represents greed perhaps because he has quite a few wives in the chicken coop.The snake represents anger perhaps because it can be quite vicious when provoked.The pig represents stupidity perhaps because he is more concerned about eating and is so blissfully ignorant of his imminent demise. Such is the nature of ignorance as described by the Buddha: we are blissfully ignorant about the great matter of life and death.​That is why we keep revolving in the Wheel of Reincarnation. We are in great suffering and do not know how to end it. We often experience great pain during Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death. That is why the Buddha’s first teaching was of the Four Noble Truths, to help us end suffering and attain liberation and bliss."},{"title":"Mantra for love","content":"Question:Ven. Master,​I most fortunately came across the Sutra regarding The Great Compassion Mantra which helped me cope with my unbearable suffering. I later learned that if I sincerely recite this Mantra 12,000 times and print the Sutra 1,200 times, I will be able to get whatever I wish.      Must I personally copy or transcribe the Sutra or are there other ways? In particular, if I sincerely have faith and recite the Mantra, will I be able to change my destiny this lifetime? For example, if I am in a relationship with one person but love another, will reciting and printing the Mantra help me  marry the one I love? Please kindly instruct me.​BTTN  Answer:I do not recall instructions to obtain those kinds of responses from the Sutras regarding the practice of The Great Compassion Mantra.I think you are probably referring to the Guan Yin White Robe Dharani in which the Guan Yin Speaks of According to your Wishes Dharani Sutra has instructions such as those to get results.If one carefully reads the specific instructions, you are supposed to recite the mantra 12,000 times (the more the better) and you will obtain limitless Dharma benefits.Furthermore, you can magnify the benefits by printing the mantra 1,200 times and widely distributing it.  The principle behind it is not so much that you must invest resources to print but rather that you encourage others to recite the mantra which then indirectly generates more benefits for yourself.I am not sure that the mantra will enable you to marry the one you love.  I doubt that the Bodhisattva would get involved in such endeavors because when love becomes hate (which in the United States seems to happen often: we have a 50% divorce rate right now) the Bodhisattva might be blamed for it!​By the way, if one sincerely recites mantras without expectations, one will receive a better response.  The only desire that I encourage in my students is that they work diligently toward enlightenment in this lifetime or toward rebirth to the Pure Land. I feel that encouraging any other kind of desire, especially for obtaining spiritual penetrations or responses, tend to nurture greed and will result in less benefit."},{"title":"Singleminded Recitation","content":"Question:Greetings Ven. Master,I practice Reciting the Buddha’s name.Why do you advocate Chan and Pure Land Joint Cultivation? Would that not be difficult to become single-minded?Emituofo,​TH      ​Answer:​Good for you!Several years ago, I started with teaching Chan in my living room. Then a few years later, I decided to teach Chan and Pure Land Joint Cultivation for these reasons:I realized that most Chan students will not make it through the Chan Dharma Door this lifetime. Therefore I urged them to practice reciting the Buddha’s name as an insurance policy.Also, most people who recite the Buddha’s name do not know how to attain the Buddha Recitation Samadhi. Their cultivation approach will not bring them to single-mindedness. That was why I urged them to train in our Mahayana Chan methodology as well.If you feel confident that you can attain single-mindedness through the Buddha Recitation method, stick to it.However, will you consider this suggestion?​The fact that you even asked me, showed that you do not know how to attain single-mindedness yet. Those who do know would never consider asking me."},{"title":"Reduce False Thinking","content":"Question:​I started reciting Guan Yin Bodhisattva’s name two weeks ago.  I try to be single-minded in my recitation in the four comportments of sitting, walking, lying or standing just like Amitabha Buddha.  Late at night, I use the recitation beads for over thirty minutes.  I can concentrate pretty well on the Bodhisattva’s name even though I worship Medicine Master Buddha.  In the morning, I recite the Medicine Master Mantra while at night I recite Guan Yin.  Is this appropriate, Master?      I am very respectful toward the Buddhas.  I do not know why when I am reciting the Buddha’s name, my head is full of bad thoughts. I would be thinking badly of certain individuals, or dark and menacing images would appear in my mind… not to mention other things that I do not feel appropriate to bring up…  Fortunately, I know how to deal with them. I let go of these thoughts and do not fight them. I simply concentrate on the Bodhisattva’s name, allowing those thoughts to pass through my mind and eventually they leave on their own.  Is my approach correct?When reciting the Buddha’s name in the four comportments and improper thoughts arise, I believe that the Buddha does not reproach us because of our heavy karmas.  Nevertheless, I feel that I fall short as my inadequacies interfere with my cultivation toward the Buddhas. What I can do to eliminate those defiled thoughts?As per Shakyamuni Buddha’s Golden Mouth, whoever is in difficulty can pray to Guan Yin Bodhisattva, Earth Store Bodhisattva, Medicine Master Buddha … to get help for oneself and other living beings, is that right?  Furthermore, Ven. Xuan Hua explained in the Earth Store Sutra that those who recite the Six Great Bright Characters of Guan Yin Bodhisattva will obtain responses from Earth Store Bodhisattva. He will bless them with happiness, security and bliss because he likes Living Beings to recite Guan Yin’s Six Great Bright Characters.  I am not sure that I understand what that means!I hope that you will clarify it for me and other Buddhist disciples in order to help us unfold our wisdom!  I wish you good health and bliss.Thank you.​VD  ​Answer:Let me try to answer your questions in the order received.Yes, you are doing just fine.  Please continue with your efforts in the four comportments.Being respectful is indeed the necessary first step before we can cultivate transcendental Dharmas.  What you are experiencing is called “false thinking:” unwanted thoughts that emerge when we cultivate.  Your approach is right on. Just do not engage: be aware of them and do not follow them.  That way, they will ultimately lessen in frequency and eventually die down.After you practice, put your palms together and repent for those defiled thoughts that arose. Say that you would like to repent for the false thinking and spell out the thoughts of which you are ashamed.  In time, these errant thoughts will die down.  This is called “practicing patience.” Patiently endure the harassment and discomfort without giving up.Yes, you can ask for help from the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for yourself or for others when you are in trouble.  For example, I have personally asked for help from Guan Yin twice so far.  Great Master Xuan Hua never tells lies.  You can believe everything he said, assuming that his teachings are properly translated.  Furthermore, unlike us, the Bodhisattvas are not jealous of each other. If you practice a Guan Yin Dharma Door, Earth Store Bodhisattva really likes it and would never hesitate to help you when he has the chance.  Similarly, Guan Yin would never get upset if Earth Store Bodhisattva helped you.Judging from your approach and accomplishments thus far, you do have good roots!  ​Therefore, let me offer a few more unsolicited pointers:Learn to sit in full lotus when you recite.If possible, recite for one hour instead of half an hour.It’s very important for you to continue to read Master Xuan Hua’s books.Bow to the Buddha for half an hour each day.If possible, read my explanation of the Bequeathed Teachings Sutra.  It’s available on our web site.   It more thoroughly explains the process of cultivation.If you can, get my Chan Handbook.  It’s available on Kindle and CreateSpace.  It will help you acquire the fundamentals of cultivation and it will answer many basic questions which are common to all beginners.Keep up the good work.  I am proud of you."},{"title":"Great Compassion Mantra Transmission","content":"Question:Ven. Master,​I read your instructions on maintaining the Great Compassion Mantra and now realize that it is more effective to receive transmission before practicing it. Also, it is my understanding that if we had conditions with Great Master Xuan Hua, we should go to his temples or seek out his students to make the request for transmission.      After we receive transmission, it will be much easier to practice it. Furthermore, the Great Master’s disciples can also instruct on how to maintain the mantra.Therefore, I would like to request instructions from you. How do I properly make this request?Emituofo,​HA  Answer:It is better to make such a request in person because it shows sincerity.However, I am not stuck on formalities. I will make an exception and will transmit this mantra to you. It is a wonderful mantra that will give you inconceivable benefits if you know how to practice it.Your first goal should be to memorize it.Start with reciting it 5 or 21 or 108 times: commit to a number and do it every day, religiously.After you sincerely recite it daily for a while, you will naturally want to do the following when possible:Abstain from eating onion and garlic, leeks, shallots, etc…Keep the Five PreceptsBecome vegetarian if possible.The overall objective is to recite single-mindedly.I hope you will also consider obtaining my book, “The Chan Handbook: The Learner’s Guide to Meditation.” The English version should be available on ebook formats on Kindle, Kobo, iBooks or Nook.

I wish you all peace, health and bliss.​TNC  Answer:You clearly have not received clear and detailed instruction on how to meditate. Your method seems to be aligned with Hinayana meditation while ours originates from the Mahayana tradition. Therefore, I dare not make comment on your approach in order to avoid confusing or discouraging you.Should you be interested in learning Mahayana meditation techniques, I would recommend that you find instruction from the Chan patriarchs. I personally learned from my late teacher, a Patriarch of Orthodox Buddhism by the name of Xuan Hua whose books I would highly recommend to you. We also have published a book on Chan called “The Chan Handbook: The Learner’s Guide to Meditation” that you can get from this link http://www.chanpureland.org/publications/chanhandbook/.Furthermore, I encourage you to continue to try and find a competent teacher to guide your meditation practice. As you are discovering, to practice meditation on your own at home is not easy because of the many obstructions that arise and the lack of specific instructions on how to overcome them.Unfortunately, I do not know of any temple in Ho Chi Minh City to refer you to.

Because of family obligations, I have not been able to leave the home life. Twenty-two years ago, I took refuge with Meditation Master Thích Thanh Từ but have not done much to be called a meditation student. I feel ashamed because I have not been able to follow my teacher’s teachings and doctrines.      In my village, there is no temple affiliated with my Vietnamese meditation master. Therefore, I have not been able to ask questions or receive instruction! As a result, I feel that I am unable to follow his meditation techniques when I cannot receive guidance. Therefore, I decided to recite the Buddha’s name, and practice bow Repentances (The Ten Thousand Buddhas Repentance). I recite the Great Compassion Mantra, Shurangama Mantra…. and listen to Great Master Xuan Hua. That is because I revere the Great Master’s vows and his conduct and feel great affinity with his Dharma.Ven. Master, if I take refuge with Great Master Xuan Hua by myself and resolve to cultivate according to his teachings, would that be betrayal of my original teacher? If it’s possible, how should I go about it? Will you provide guidance, introduce me to Good Knowing Advisers, lay people who are practicing his Dharma so that I can be even more vigorous and blissful!Na Mo Bliss Treasury Bodhisattva Mahasattva!I am teaching in school and I have two underage children. I realize that they are my karmic debt and that I must try to repay them. Although I am not a left home person, I have been mindful of the temple for many years. Would it be too greedy to consider leaving the home life; is it upside-down thinking? Please kindly instruct me!(I often listen to the Great Master’s Dharma sounds but have no co-cultivators and therefore I often think of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, and I pray that someone would teach me so that I do it right!)Emituofo,​TN  Answer:I am answering this even though it should directed to the CTTB. Perhaps someday they’ll have some kind of Q&A so that they can properly respond to these kinds of queries and then we will not have to do so. But since they do not have a way to respond, I’ll try to answer the best I can.You are doing just fine.You only have to take refuge once with the Triple Jewel. Afterward, you are free to cultivate any Dharma Door that works for you.Since you have been practicing Great Master Xuan Hua’s Dharma, you are already under his protection and guidance. That is how you got to us, so that we could provide further clarification for your cultivation.I am afraid I cannot refer you to any Good Knowing Adviser in Vietnam. Great Master Xuan Hua’s competent left home disciples are American. It’ll be quite a while before their teachings will become available in Vietnamese. You should not look at any lay person as your teacher or mentor unless it is sanctioned by Great Master Xuan Hua. Therefore, your best bet is to continue cultivating as you have been. I feel that you should also read all the Great Master’s teachings in addition to listening to his Dharma sounds. When you have some free time, you should also read my teachings, particularly my explanations of the Bequeathed Teachings Sutra because it has clear instructions for self-cultivators.I sympathize with your decision to practice meditation without guidance. Since you have been vigorously cultivating by yourself, I feel that you should read my Chan Handbook: the Learner’s Guide to Meditation, because it will build a more solid foundation for your practice. Afterward, when you have further questions about cultivation, please ask again. The Vietnamese version should be available on CreateSpace within a month (in November 2012) because we are going through the final proofing phase.Continue to repay your debts. You can always leave the home life after your children are grown. Personally, I feel that leaving the home life is not as important as being able to cultivate the Proper Dharma that can help you attain liberation. Although you are not able to leave the home life, you have already found the Proper Dharma. You are already way ahead.​Please keep up the good work."},{"title":"Eliminate Three Poisons with Recitation","content":"​Question:Greetings to you, Master! I have a few questions.​In the Universal Chapter [of the Lotus Sutra], Shakyamuni Buddha says that those who recite GuanYin’s name will be able to eliminate greed, hatred and stupidity… Therefore, how should I go about reciting her name in order to achieve those objectives? I am not particularly worried about hatred and stupidity, however, my sexual desires are particularly strong.       After I recited for a few weeks the demon of sexual desires harassed me constantly, urging me to look at inappropriate films or controlling myself. I believe it’s because of habit energies from prior lives!I believe that the Buddhist sutras are very profound and that I do not yet fully understand them. Please help clarify their meaning to me. Each day, I still recite GuanYin’s name during the four comportments of walking, standing, lying or sitting. Is there anything that I am missing?As per the Buddha’s golden mouth, whoever is in difficulty can pray to GuanYin, Earth Store Bodhisattva, Medicine Master Buddha etc… to get help for themselves or for others, is that right? In Master XuanHua’s explanations of the Earth Store Sutra, he says that if we recite the Six Great Characters Mantra of GuanYin, then Earth Store Bodhisattva will bless us with happiness, peace and bliss because he really likes all of us to recite that mantra. Did I state that correctly? I have some doubts about this matter!I started reciting GuanYin’s name for three months now in all of my four comportments. I try to become single-minded like Amitabha Buddha: at night, I concentrate in reciting GuanYin’s name for 30 minutes with my recitation beads. I worship Medicine Master Buddha (I recite his mantra in the morning), I recite GuanYin and Earth Store Bodhisattvas’ names in the evening. Is that appropriate?Thank you! I apologize for my wordiness! Please kindly instruct me!​MD  Answer:Just like learning any craft, you need time to perfect it. Just keep at it and one day you’ll perfect it.To be honest with you, I have been reciting the Bodhisattvas’ names for over twenty years and yet I still have the three poisons. In all fairness, my three poisons are considerably a lot less than I when first started. Why? It’s like washing our hands: the more grime and grease we have accumulated, the longer it takes to wash them clean. If we stop then our hands will never be clean. Keep on washing and let nature take its course: we will eventually get there!If you can’t control your urges then you need help temporarily. One way is to ask for help from the Triple Jewel: that is the “Others’ Power” part of the help. Another way is to confess or repent to others publicly: perhaps shame will help because so far there is no penalty for making that kind of mistake. In brief, keep on trying.The one thing that will help for sure is to recite GuanYin’s name more fervently when you have the urge and continue until the urge goes away instead of succumbing to it. Keep at it until your urges can be controlled and eventually they will die down.You still seem to be greedy for quick fixes. It takes four years to earn a Bachelor’s degree and yet you wish to get what you want by reciting the Bodhisattvas’ names only after doing it for three months?Keep reciting and stop being so greedy. When you recite their names, you are requesting for help. It takes a while before you are “worthy” to be helped. Better yet, stop demanding for responses: just keep on scrubbing until your hands are clean.​There is nothing wrong with your practice. Perhaps, you could learn from the Chan School to increase your concentration power to receive even more benefit out of your daily practice."},{"title":"Great Compassion Mantra Transmission","content":"Question:Ven. Master:I would like to recite the Great Compassion Mantra. How do I get started? I researched on the internet and found many conflicting instructions. I worry that if I do it improperly, it would make it difficult to concentrate on my recitation. The truth is, I am ill. How should I pray for help? Please kindly instruct me.​TD      Answer:I tend to be very conservative especially when it comes to practicing Secret School Dharmas such as mantras. In my humble opinion, one should not pick up mantras on the internet to practice for many reasons. I’ll name just two here:I have found that quite often, the instructions are incomplete or inaccurate. For example, on some of the hundreds of Daily Recitation Handbooks compiled for some other temples, there were a few lines that were missing from the Great Compassion Mantra.Secret Dharmas must be transmitted before they can be cultivated successfully. What that means to you, is that when the mantra is properly transmitted, there are many benefits that happen “behind the scenes” (like Dharma Protectors being sent to assist and protect you). This will result in your being able to concentrate better and obtain more responses.For a complete copy of the Great Compassion Mantra, please visit our web site. I’ve included the link here for your convenience: http://www.chanpureland.org/texts/. Select “Daily Recitation Handbook,” you will find the mantra on page 69. More importantly, you should find a competent sanghan to officially transmit it to you before you begin practicing it.To practice, you can start with reciting the mantra 21 times a day and eventually increase it to 108 times a day.My sympathies to you for your illness.When people are sick, they seek out a competent doctor’s opinion. Similarly, you should personally make an appointment with a Good Knowing Adviser and ask for instruction on how to deal with your illness.Then, you’ll be taught how to cultivate to obtain help from the Dharma. The more sincere you are, the more likely that you will receive better instruction and obtain more responses.Until then, I suggest that at the end of each day’s recitation, you dedicate the merit and virtue from your cultivation to those beings that are tormenting you so that you can get better.My best wishes!"},{"title":"Donning the Sash of Liberation","content":"Question:Na Mo Fundamental Teacher Shakyamuni Buddha!Ven. Master,​I am 18 years old. I may be young but I feel that I have a clear idea of what to do with my life. My family has been Buddhist for many generations. When I was young, my father set up an altar at home for Guan Yin: it is lovingly decorated and made me so happy. My father would often offer flowers, lamps, water, fruits, and candles to the Triple Jewel. Visitors would often compliment the altar, saying how adorned it is. As a result, I have had a very positive impression of Buddhism and became personally interested.      When I was 17 years old I took refuge with the Triple Jewel. Now, I wish to leave the home life, not for the sake of ending birth and death and getting out of the Wheel. I only wish to become a left-home person: bald-headed and in particular, having the honor of wearing the yellow robe of liberation. This is because every time I went to recite sutras at the temple, and I saw the monks and nuns with their yellow robes and sashes in the Buddha Hall, it filled me with the utmost respect and admiration. And I often wished that someday I too would be able to don the yellow robe!Ven. Master, I asked my mother for permission to leave the home life a couple of times. She said that that kind of lifestyle is full of hardship: getting up at 3 or 4am for the morning ceremony and then working at chores until late at night. However, I am undaunted and I feel that I can handle it!My fear is that I have a tattoo of a flower on my wrist about the size of a joint of my finger, and I worry that because of it, a temple might refuse me as a prospective left-home disciple! Ven. Master, please tell us more about your reasons for leaving the home life and instruct me on what to do? If my family is against it, may I go to a temple at a faraway place and leave the home life under a master?Emituofo,​TN  Answer:To be born into a family of many generations of Buddhists is indeed to be very blessed.Allow me to defer talking about my personal reasons for leaving the home life to another time and place.Your mother is right: you should perhaps get a better idea about the home life before you jump in head-first. Ask for permission to come and stay at the temple where you wish to live to get a feel of the environment.Your small tattoo should not be a problem at all. If any monk or nun objects to it, then he or she probably is not the one for you to follow anyway.​Your family is very blessed. You should use them as a proving ground of your sincerity. It is better to leave the home life on good terms with your family. Unless your enlightened Master approves otherwise, it is always better to obtain your parents’ permission."},{"title":"Parents’ Approval To Leave The Home Life","content":"Question:Dear Venerable Master,How do I help my parents to allow me to leave the home life?​TT      Answer:Parents want their children to be happy. If your parents believe that you’ll be happier as a left home person, then they will agree to make this major sacrifice and will not obstruct you.Start slowly!First take the time to find the right Good Knowing Adviser (GKA) for you. He or she must have the spiritual skills and blessings to be able to teach you. Through your GKA’s guidance, you will draw closer to the Triple Jewel and as a result, you will become a much happier person. I would like to suggest that you attend extended cultivation programs such as The Buddha Recitation Week or Chan Week.If you already have a Good Knowing Adviser please discuss this with him or her. Your GKA should be able to determine whether or not becoming a nun is appropriate for you. Then he or she would know how to help you pave the way for your parents’ acceptance."},{"title":"Baby Cultivator","content":"Question:I started cultivating the Medicine Master Dharma door two months ago. I know very little about cultivation and wish to ask you a few questions to clarify my understanding:​1. In the morning, I recite the Medicine Master Buddha mantra. I stop reciting before it becomesmonotonous, so I won’t become bored with it the following day. Afterward, I recite Medicine Master Buddha’s name 108 times with the recitation beads and bow to the Buddha in repentance.      2. In the evening, I sit in front of the Triple Jewel altar at home to recite Earth Store Bodhisattva and Guan Yin, 108 times each, and then I bow to the Buddha in repentance.3. Before going to bed, I try to recite Amitabha Buddha and Shakyamuni Buddha’s names 108 times each because they are the biggest name Buddhas in this Saha world. Then I bow in repentance.…Occasionally, I recite another Buddha or Bodhisattva’s names in gratitude.I used to recite the Medicine Master Sutra, however now I only recite the Buddha’s name because it helps me be more focused.I am just a baby on the path to cultivation; there still is a lot that I don’t understand. I am learning to do good deeds and then I transfer the merit and virtue to all living beings, ghosts and spirits who are suffering… Because of my heavy karmic obstructions, I can only generate few blessings, but I sincerely wish to help them and I pray on their behalf. At the same time, I also pray for myself. Because I suffer so much, I appeal to the Buddha for help. I heard that one should not pray for oneself, but I have also heard that the Buddhas wish to aid and rescue living beings and therefore I think I should be able to pray for myself too. Does that make sense, Ven. Master?I have an affinity with Medicine Master Buddha and I venerate him. However, I also recite Guan Yin’s name frequently. Is that OK, Master? Reciting Guan Yin’s name helps me concentrate better in my daily activities. Medicine Master Buddha’s name seems a bit long and complicated to recite, making it difficult to concentrate! That is why I recite it as Na Mo Medicine Master Buddha, Medicine Master Buddha. Is this alright?When reciting the Buddha’s name, I recite both Buddhas’ names at the same time for 108 times with the recitation beads. Is this appropriate?Thank you for reading my request and answering it!​VD  Answer:That is what I call vigor!Let me give you a few suggestions:Recite the Medicine Master Buddha mantra 108 times each day. Pay no attention to that boredom: it comes uninvited and goes away by itself too.Learn to sit in full lotus if at all possible. It will help you concentrate better. Keep up with the bowing daily: it is very beneficial for beginners.Reciting the Buddha’s name is very good for eradicating retributions.At the end of each day of cultivation, please make transference of merit and virtue to all living beings for the sake of their obtaining rebirth to the Pure Land. It is better to not make transference to oneself: you get more blessings in return when you offer it to others.Reciting Guan Yin’s name is very good as it works well for you. As for reciting Medicine Master Buddha’s name, try reciting: Yao Shi Ru Lai (Medicine Master Thus Come One).It is better to recite one Buddha’s name that many times and then recite the other Buddha’s name.Please keep up with your cultivation: it will gradually help alleviate your suffering and it will create blessings for you to encounter a competent teacher who can teach you how to deal with your problems.May I suggest that you also try the following?Read up on Great Master Xuan Hua’s teachings. Then read up on my teachings. They will help you learn more about Mahayana and plant the proper seeds of wisdom.In particular, read carefully my explanations of the Bequeathed Teachings Sutra: it is designed for serious cultivators.Commit to following the instructions of my Chan Handbook: The Learner’s Guide to Meditation, it will be tremendously beneficial in building your concentration. It should be available soon in Vietnamese on CreateSpace. As I get older, I have become lazier. I do get tired of repeating the same instructions on the fundamentals of cultivation and therefore I decided to write a book on meditation so that all of you can use it as a reference.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope that you will find a Good Knowing Adviser soon."},{"title":"Ayurveda Healing","content":"Question:dhanyathma,i’m an ayurveda doctor. now i’m 50yrs old.i have studied in hindu philosophy that when we give medicines we are taking one part of the karma of the patient. that will come to the doctor. is his right?please give me ur kind answer. thanking u for ur kindness.with salutations​Dr. R      Answer:Yes, according to Buddhist beliefs, illness is the natural settling of karmic debt. When third parties like yourself, wade in and “meddle” in that repayment process, you will have to bear the burden of the debt. The better you are at it, the more karmic burden you will end up having to shoulder, either this lifetime or in future lives.

They elaborated on some topics such as merit and virtue, and reincarnation…      May ask you this question: If I wish to read sutras in order to increase my blessings, which sutra should I start with?Also, my teachers said that by increasing one’s blessings, one can actually change one’s destiny, is that correct? Thank you very much!​DA  Answer:In my humble opinion, all sutras are equally beneficial in generating blessings. You can start with any sutra that you want. I recommend that you concentrate on the Mahayana sutras, which are translated from Sanskrit, because they generate more blessings than any other type of Buddhist sutra.More importantly, you want to focus on the credible authors. For example, I highly recommend that you read all the books from my late teacher and Patriarch, Great Master Xuan Hua. You should stick to the writings by the Buddhist patriarchs because they give you the proper views and knowledge.​Yes, if one accrues the right kind of blessings, one can alter one’s own fate."},{"title":"Wish to leave home life","content":"Question:Emituofo. I am very honored to know you. Do you accept female left-home disciples who really wish to cultivate?Amituofo​AN      Answer:Thank you for your inquiry.I have accepted and am training female left-home disciples. They are required to live in the temple for one year to build their blessings. Then they must go through a special two-year novice training program before they are considered for ordination. This applies to men as well since we do not discriminate based genders, ethnicities or ages.​Since we are a small temple, we concentrate on investing our limited resources on training only those who have demonstrated their utmost sincerity in leaving the home life. The reason for leaving the home life is to receive in-depth training and build the proper foundation to obtain liberation or rebirth to the Pure Land."},{"title":"Mystic Universe","content":"Question:There is a Tibetan sect called Mystic Universe.

Xuan Hua always emphasized to us that in order to teach Westerners, we’ll have to teach about morality. True to his teachings, his disciples emphasize goodness and decency, although they have tremendous skills and powers through tantras, even more so that most specialists in Tantric Schools. Why? It’s because Tantric practices are not meant to be known, let alone advertised as “Mystic”, special powers or special knowledge.I too agree with my master. Mahayana is about knowing how to resolve your daily problems with goodness and morality.​I would not take seriously people who advertise special abilities and mysticism."},{"title":"Lethal Oath","content":"Question:Venerable Master:​I am a Buddhist disciple.

I wish you bliss and hope that you will continue to create a lot of merit and virtue through your Dharma propagation work.Please forgive me if I improperly addressed you in making this request.Respectfully,​NVC  Answer:The next time this happens, he should immediately seek a sanghan and repent. This is called confessing to a wise adviser. It will help reduce future retributions. Specifically, he must confess that he knows that his habit is wrong and that he wishes to stop this self-destructive behavior.If the sanghan possesses enough Way virtue to overcome your cousin’s obstruction, he can then receive the help needed to eradicate his bad habit.You are quite right, if he has enough blessings, he will be able to encounter a virtuous sanghan who can appropriately help him.These honorable sanghans are very hard to meet because they shun the limelight. Since I rarely have the opportunity to travel, I do not know many of these sanghans. For example, there are quite a few of them in the US.

To get the most out of your recitation, when you recite sutras, make sure you are free: drop everything and concentrate on the recitation.It is not necessary to strike the woodfish when reciting sutras. Generally, the woodfish is used in order to help the assembly recite at the same pace; it is not necessary when reciting by yourself.​To assist you in having a child, I recommend that you sincerely and regularly recite the Universal Door Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra. I understand that disciples who have regularly recited this section of the Lotus Sutra have received help for this very request. For example, one of Master XuanHua’s disciples told me that she had tried everything with no success. Then she recited this chapter every day for three years. She also sincerely bowed to the GuanYin Bodhisattva. Miraculously, she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy."},{"title":"Chan Healing","content":"Question:Ven. Master,Last Saturday, our four brothers and sisters were very blessed to personally receive your generous Chan teachings.I would like to ask two questions:​1. Normally I feel a chill in my body, however when I sit in meditation, I would feel hot and even perspire. Is that a good state and why?      2. In one of your books, you mentioned a disciple who reached Eighth samadhi. Thanks to the Chan practice she was cured of cancer. If illnesses are the results of our past karmic offenses, such as killing karmas, then what role does practicing Chan have in settling these types of karmic debts?Thank you very much.​TNQ  Answer:It was very nice to finally meet with you. I hope that you will continue to keep up your Chan practice and further develop your samadhi power.Your body’s chilling sensations are due to poor blood circulation. The way we practice Chan helps quickly remedies that by focusing on our dan-tien. Furthermore, your concentration has greatly increased thus generating more body heat and causing perspiration. Keep up and good work.You are probably referring to one of my disciples who surpassed the Eighth samadhi and who successfully managed to put her cancer in remission. She was ordered by her doctor to get off the medication that she was supposed to take for the rest of her life.It was a combination of the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma and Chan meditation that healed her. In her case, the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma brought her cancer under control and her daily Chan practice kept her karmic debts in check.In general, Chan is a very powerful form of repentance and debt repayment. That is why Chan practitioners invariably become healthier.

My dad is a believer of the Cao Đài faith, while my mom is Buddhist.​When I was young, I used to come to a Cao Đài temple to make contributions. Occasionally, I would also follow my mother to the temple to bow to the Buddhas.       As I grew older, I no longer frequented the Cao Đai temple and would accompany my mother to the Buddhist temple on mid month days of the lunar months.In my dreams, I often see myself flying in the sky, walking on water or the tips of grass blades. At times, I would dream that I was at the Cao Đài temple but it was as if I was an invisible presence because no one paid attention to me; I would hang out there but never could participate in any full ceremony session there. Sometimes, I would dream of the Buddha and GuanYin Bodhisattva: I would then kneel in front of them and recited the Buddha’s name.Now, I wish to take refuge with the Triple Jewel but my mother would not hear of it and wants me to follow my dad’s faith. While I have faith in both religions but I prefer to be Buddhist.Please kindly advice what I should do?Thank you very much!​DH  Answer:My teacher, the late patriarch, Ven. XuanHua, says that all religions are not outside of Buddhism.That is because:Fundamentally, all religious faiths advocate goodness. All the goodness taught in other religions is encompassed in the Buddhist goodness.Buddhism is all encompassing.He no longer discriminates.Since you are not yet non-discriminating, I’ll propose the following:It is very good to have a religious faith. It provides balance in life. For example, I really like the fact that the Catholics go to church on Sundays because it helps them touch base with the inherent goodness in them instead of spending that time plotting to serve their insatiable egos.Since you are still living at home, it is not advisable to go against your parents’ wishes. If you feel that strongly about acting on your religious beliefs, why should you even become Cao Đai at all? Just keep the status quo since both your parents are OK with it.You could become Buddhist after you moved out of the house and asserted your independence financially. There is no rush, is there? As long as you stay on the good side, then you are acting like a Buddhist already. The Buddhist practices discreetly: they do not advertise themselves.After you’ve asserted your independence then it’s time for you to begin to gently tell your parents about your desire to not ever force religious faiths onto your children and that you will respect their choices for religions.Make sure that your potential spouses respect your personal faith. Those who have little respect for religions are not good mates in the long haul. Most of them make for very poor parenting as well because they are not good role models for the next generation."},{"title":"Meddling without being asked","content":"Question:Can the Buddhist “meddle” even when she is not asked for help?​VS      Answer:The sages can.For us, unenlightened people, it is not advisable to meddle without being asked.Why? That is how the Buddhists practice respect and patience. We have profound respect others and therefore respect their decision to suffer instead of asking for help or accepting our help. We also practice patience by enduring it, knowing full well that it may hurt deeply too from watching their senseless self-torture, but choose to patiently wait until they are ready to ask us to help. To force help down their throat may not work and might destroy our chance to help them in the future.​Having said that, there is another way.

When they have enough blessings, they will no longer have objections to your help."},{"title":"Sever Desire","content":"Question:​I am a 21 year old student. I have studied Buddhism for half a year so far. Since I understand Buddhism, I realize that I have created so many offenses… For example, I liked to kill living beings when I was young… When I was 14 years old (I was in the seventh grade), through the TV programs I saw many sexy images and naturally wanted to see more of such images.      When I entered the university and was away from my family, it got worse with the availability of the internet… I became hooked on the pornographic sites… The more I watched, the more I became captivated… At times, realizing that it adversely affected my studies, I wanted to stop… However, I told myself that it’s no big deal: “I eventually will get bored”.Unfortunately, I never seem to get enough and it only became worse.Fortunately, six months ago I encountered Buddhism. I learned about the Pure Land Dharma Door. After watching some rebirth videos, I was very touched. I therefore resolved to recite the Buddha’s name seeking rebirth to the Pure Land and started becoming vegetarian.A month ago, I ran into trouble. Because of jealousy, my cousin had a disagreement over minor inconsequential issues and stabbed me. The blade broke and made me seriously injured. I am lucky that I am still alive… The incident helped me realize the impermanence of life.At the moment, my desires are still very heavy… While I know it full well, I can’t help it because there are so many temptations: internet, TV, newspapers… Many of my friends are also in the same boat… We can’t seem to help ourselves when we are in such close contact. Even though it is not as bad as before, my habit energies are still pretty heavy… Now that I like a girl, I can’t seem to get my mind of her.Is my case severe by normal standards, Venerable Master? Is there a cure for it? I wish I have more samadhi power so that I am less agitated. Please advise!If reciting the Buddha’s name can eradicate the offenses of 80 hundred millions of kalpas of birth and deaths, can I recite the Buddha’s name in order to erase the karmas that I have created this lifetime? Or does that claim have other hidden meanings?I am very grateful for your instructions!Na mo Emituofo!​HNT  Answer:Thank you for sharing your concerns.You are doing better than the average people of your age. Why? Because you are aware of your problems when the rest of them are not.Furthermore, you are going through growing pains. It is natural that during this phase of your life, your hormones are dictating your actions.Eventually, you’ll outgrow it.However, it does not hurt to make sure that you are on firmer footing and ascending in the right direction.To put it simply, the fastest way for you to get there is to learn to meditate.Find a competent, Chan meditation teacher to guide you. Your objective is to enter samadhi as soon as possible. Once you can reach samadhi, your desires will naturally lessen and become lighter. You’ll then have more control over your hormones.More specifically, you need to reach at least First Dhyana in order to have more self-control. May I suggest that you recite Guan Yin Bodhisattva’s name when you meditate? It will help tone down your desires. It also helps to bow to the Bodhisattva to help eradicate your offenses as well.​Finally, it is true that reciting the Buddha’s name can eradicate 80 hundred million kalpas of offenses. However, not everyone can. Only those with very high levels of samadhi can do so. Regardless, for people like us, it can still eradicate a lot of offenses proportionally to our samadhi level. You are right: there is no free lunch! It is not that easy! By the way, reciting Guan Yin’s name can also assure rebirth to the Pure Land."},{"title":"Peaceful Country","content":"Question:Greetings to you, Master.​I am 17 years and am in school.

It would have saved me a lot of time.I would like to suggest looking at the Confucian model from the Buddhist perspective:Rectify yourself: correct your mistakes. In particular, learn about the Five Precepts and Bodhisattva Precepts. Observing precepts is the ultimate form of cleansing oneself.Keep your family harmonious: Learn to love, respect and cooperate with the people that count the most in your life. The Asian culture tends to be weaker in interpersonal and communication skills. Look for ways to improve yourself in that area. You should seriously consider cultivating samadhi: for example, practice Chan to develop concentration which unfolds wisdom. Wise people make the right decisions and are in a better position to help others.Govern the country: Acquire real skills to contribute to society. Learn to sacrifice yourself for the greater good of the people.Pacify the world: Broaden your mind to benefit all, not just your countrymen. Become a citizen of the world and seek to truly benefit all living beings.Start with baby steps; do instead of talk. Become Buddhist and receive the Precepts.

If he or she has not received the Five Precepts, does that count as a violation?3.If there is a violation is there a way to erase it?Thank you for your instruction,​NVA  Answer:1. Yes, the Deviant Sex violation only applies to those who received the Deviant Sex Precept, which is one of the Five Precepts. By the way, you can selectively receive the precepts that you feel you can keep. There is no need to receive all Five Precepts if you can’t uphold them. In particular, the Deviant Sex Precept is very hard to observe in this day and age. People should not receive it at all if they can’t uphold it.2. The Deviant Sex Precept prohibits sexual intercourse outside of marriage, even if the marriage is an unhappy one.3. Yes, there is a way to repent for the violations. For this you need to see a competent left home person who is qualified to advise you. This is not something you can do through correspondence or through the Internet. It can only be explained in person. In fact, few left home people are qualified to teach you how to repent. Should you have doubts about their approach, you can contact us again and describe their approach. We can then advise you privately about its validity and effectiveness.​In general, I wish that left home people would spend enough time to educate their disciples on the Five Precepts before transmitting them. This would then help prevent potential problems."},{"title":"Hands and Eyes Transmission","content":"Question:Na Mo Fundamental Teacher Shakyamuni Buddha,My respects to the sangha!Please advise me as to how I can learn about the 42 Hands & Eyes.I would appreciate an email answer.Emituofo,​TTH      Answer:One must receive transmission for this particular type of Tantric Dharma before it can be practiced. For example, I received transmission but I am not authorized to transmit it. I do know of some people who are authorized to transmit it but I am not authorized to tell you who they are.However, you can create affinity with this Dharma by memorizing the Great Compassion Mantra and reciting it daily. Or you can make offerings to Guan Yin Bodhisattva, by sincerely bowing to it daily.​Once you have enough blessings, then you will receive transmission."},{"title":"Writing out the Lotus Sutra","content":"​Question:Hi Dharma Master Yong Hua,​I have read the commentaries of Master Hsuan Hua on the Dharma Flower Sutra and also have read the Sutra itself many times. The Sutra and Master Hsuan Hua emphasized that by writing out or employing others writing it out, one can gain infinite merit. The more sincere one is the more merit one gains.       From that i started writing out the Dharma Flower Sutra with my own hand. I gained so many benefits from writing it out. I have understood more about the Sutra, gained more appreciation on the Sutra, and also realized how wise the Buddha is by encouraging us to write out the Sutra by hand. From that benefits I wanted to employ others to write it out. So can you give me some suggestions?Thank you,​QN  Answer:Thank you for sharing your experience from writing the Lotus Sutra!Your wonderful response can be attributed to the Lotus Sutra because of the following:When you spend time to create things of pure beauty and goodness, you reset your mind and free it from worldly preoccupations. It’s a nice break from mundane afflictions.To focus on the writing of the Sutra increases your concentration. I would not be surprised at all if while doing this, you felt a general sense of well-being and this feeling would increase as you continually wrote out the Lotus Sutra, day after day. That is called Chan bliss.In my humble opinion, one of the most precious gifts you have received from this experience is your growing trust in the words of the Buddha and sages; this has resulted in even deeper faith.One cannot go further in cultivation without more profound faith.Traditionally, another reason that we were encouraged to copy and write scriptures was because of the lack of printing presses. Nowadays, most people prefer to make donations to print sutras. This is more “efficient” because it makes the Buddha’s teachings more widely available. It also generates tremendous blessings.There are many sponsors of sutra printings. Master Xuan Hua’s explanation is one of the more outstanding ones. He has plenty of sponsors who make generous donations to print his books.A Dharma protector once came and inquired to the Buddha what to do if he wanted to make offerings to the Dharma Jewel. The World Honored One replied that he should make offerings to Ven. Ananda because he held the treasury of the Dharma. After receiving the offering from that Dharma protector, Ven. Ananda offered it to Ven. Shariputra. His rationale was that Shariputra thoroughly understood the teachings and was the chief teaching monk of the Buddha. Shariputra then immediately brought the offerings to the Buddha because he felt that the Buddha was the best teacher of the world.Perhaps you would consider supporting left home people with the request that they explain Mahayana sutras. This would help increase the understanding and continuation of the teachings of the Buddha. Mahayana sutras do not exist in books; they actually reside in all of us. They must reside within many members of the next generation so that they will be able to take on the mantel and continue the propagation of the Dharma after my generation is done. Each of us must do our part to keep the Triple Jewel alive in the Saha world.I am rather concerned that many left home people are preoccupied with building temples and increasing the numbers of their following instead of building understanding in Mahayana. Instead of making donations to build temples and edifices, I wish that the faithful would make donations to those who explain Mahayana sutras so that they can concentrate on teaching the principles. The building of minds and hearts is much more monumental and has longer lasting effects.​As to personally transcribing sutras, it is more of a personal practice rather than a group effort. You could encourage others to write sutras too if they are interested. Those with sincerity will enjoy the experience just like you."},{"title":"Country Peaceful and People Safe","content":"Question:​Greetings to you, Master.I am 17 years and am in school.​Please tell me what I can do to learn Buddhism daily so that I can help others, wishing for my country to be at peace and my countrymen safe and happy.       Answer:​This is a good question from a good young man. I wish I could ask such a question when I was at your age. It could have saved me a lot of time.You could use the Confucian model under Buddhist light:Rectify yourself: correct your mistakes. In particular, learn about the Five Precepts and Bodhisattva Precepts. Observing precepts is the ultimate form of cleansing oneself.Keep your family harmonious: Learn to love, respect and work with the people that count the most in your life. The Asian culture tends to be weaker in interpersonal and communication skills. You should seriously consider cultivating samadhi: for example, practice Chan to develop concentration which unfolds wisdom. Wise people make the right decisions and are in a better position to help others.Govern the country: Acquire real skills to contribute to society. Learn to sacrifice yourself for the greater good of the people. Pacify the world: Broaden your mind to benefit all, not just your countrymen. Become a citizen of the world and seek to truly benefit all living beings.Start with baby steps instead of talk. Become Buddhist and receive the Precepts. Then find a good meditation teacher: this will help you develop the strength and knowledge to help others.If I need to summarize it for you: find a good and wise teacher or role model.

He taught me to sit in full lotus and use the breath counting technique.Is it possible for me to attend a few of your Saturday sessions to learn and then practice at home?Thank you very much.​TNQ  Answer:Thank you for your inquiry.Yes you certainly may and should.We will be teaching the secret techniques of the Chan patriarchs at our meditation class; we would certainly be glad to teach you as much as you can absorb.​In the future, if there is interest, we would consider organizing a one-day Chan class at your local temple too."},{"title":"Almost Deviant Sex","content":"Question:Ven. Master:I am a Buddhist who resolved to receive the Five Precepts. I am concerned about the correct behavior I should have to observe the Deviant Sex Precept. I did learn about the Five Precepts but unfortunately my knowledge is rather limited. I thought that the Deviant Sex Precept applied to married people only. Upon reviewing my actions, I think I violated the Deviant Sex Precept with a male friend who also comes to the temple but who has not received the Five Precepts.      Once, we got together and shared a bed. We touched each other but did not go all the way. I am very worried that I violated the Deviant Sex Precept and wonder what can be done to reduce the retribution for the infractions. Does reciting the Buddha’s name help reduce the offense?Please kindly tell me what to do to address this problem.​Na Mo Fundamental Teacher Shakyamuni Buddha.M  Answer: Yes, you both violated the Deviant Sex Precept. However, it’s repentable because you did not violate the UNREPENTABLE part. Your male friend did not violate the Deviant Sex Precept per se but still violated the Precept of the Nature. I can’t go into the details because I can only explain this to those who have received the Five Precepts.I wish that left home people received better training about the precepts before transmitting them to avoid this type of problem. As you can well imagine, this situation happens quite frequently. Yes, reciting the Buddha’s will help eradicate the offense. However, if you continue to violate the precept, no repentance Dharma will work.While it’s commendable that you wish to observe the Five Precepts, once you start touching each other it’s quite difficult to stop. If you wish to continue this sexual relationship, you should relinquish the Deviant Sex Precept."},{"title":"Shamini Precepts Transmission by Nun (part 2)","content":"Question:Does it mean that bhikshunis cannot transmit shamini precepts either?

I am also studying Buddhism. The Buddha came to our world out of his measureless kindness and compassion. He wants all of us to recognize and believe in ourselves and accept the law of cause of effect. How can there possibly be seeking and praying to spirits and ghosts to get responses [not clear from Vietnamese question].       How can there be responses or results from the Medicine Master Buddha and Rebirth Dharmas as you explained to your disciples? Selling and buying Buddhism is contrary to the Buddha’s teachings. The Buddhist disciples’ faith are already weak as it already is. I hope that you will correct the erroneous teachings so that they are consistent with the true principles.​Thank you.  Answer:I appreciate your input. You are right in saying that you are still learning about Buddhism. May I say that you have quite a long way to go in light of the wording and protocol you used, and your lack of understanding of the principles?However, I’d like to briefly answer your points in order to express my appreciation of your sincerity and constructive questions.Before you jump to conclusions, please invest more time investigating the Medicine Master Buddha and Rebirth Dharmas. We are not praying to ghosts and spirits to obtain responses. If we do pray at all, it’s to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.I learned these Dharmas from Great Master Xuan Hua. We use the same Dharmas which are also utilized in the Chinese temples of his predecessor, Great Master Xu Yun. These Dharmas have been passed down for generations and have been practiced by the patriarchs who are in direct lineage of the Buddha. I am not sure where you have been learning your Buddhism. To say that it’s all the same is tantamount to saying that all universities and diplomas are the same!Who’s saying that there is selling or buying? They are just another form of donations to the Triple Jewel in order to do the Buddha’s work.You may say that your temples do not have such Dharmas. I say that maybe that your temples do not know about them.If there are no responses from these Dharmas then millions of smart and astute Asian Buddhist disciples many of whom have PhD’s and are successful business people have been duped. It would be arrogant to assume that you would know more than they do. Just talk to people who have obtained such responses before rejecting the Proper Dharma.Those who are truly blessed will believe in the Great Dharmas. The deeper the faith, the greater the responses.I wish you success in all your endeavors."},{"title":"Fooled","content":"​Question:Greetings!!!​I am 21 years old and I am confused.

I am cautious of everyone.​I feel that life’s challenges are just too overwhelming. It seems like everyone is against me. Please tell me what to do. I am anxiously waiting for your response.  Answer:Just because people hurt you does not mean that you cannot forgive them.You should learn to let go of the hurt and ignore the scars. From the Buddhist way of looking at things, maybe you owe them, and that is why they can cheat you. If you don’t really owe them, there is nothing they can do to you. Therefore, you might as well pay up your past karmic debts willingly because you have no choice anyway.There is a saying: “Fool me once: shame on you!

Under normal conditions, they usually ask their male counterpart to fulfill this responsibility. Those bhikshunis who choose to transmit the precepts without the help of a monk are doing their disciples a great disservice because bhikshunis do not have the authority to do this. Their disciples are not receiving the precept substance and as a result, they will face great difficulties in their practice.​Finally, only left home people are allowed to read and consult the Precepts manuals.

However, I really enjoy sitting in full lotus and whenever I can, I do. Now, my sits have increased to 45 minutes. I notice that when I recite the Buddha’s name or a mantra while sitting in full lotus, I get tired more easily than when I’m reciting while circumambulating. Could I please have your opinion on the following:1. If I only sit in full lotus without meditating,are there any benefits?2. When I’m sitting in full lotus for 45 minutes while following my breath, is that considered meditation? Are there any risks involved?​TNQ   Answer:You are doing just fine. There is nothing to worry about.It is OK for beginners to practice Chan on their own. I do emphasize that all meditators should seek a competent Chan teacher (also known as a Good Knowing Adviser) to train under in order to gain more benefits as well as to avoid potential problems. The rationale is this: it is most critical to build the proper foundation so that you will continue to progress toward higher and higher levels smoothly.It is a very good idea to sit in full lotus whenever you can. Please continue to increase the length of your sit.It is also a very good sign that you felt more tired when in full lotus than when circumambulating, which is a walking meditation. Please keep it up. Your tiredness will eventually go away, and soon you’ll feel much better sitting in full lotus while making your recitations. Regarding your questions:Yes, you will receive inconceivable benefits every time you sit in full lotus.It’s OK to meditate in full lotus while following your breath. It is perfectly safe to do so at your current level.Finally, if possible, please make the effort to make an appointment with my staff and come and meet with me.

If so, what are the consequences if one is determined to follow the Buddha’s teachings?      Answer:Allow me to make a clarification about this sensitive issue.Personally, I have no problem. I do not pass judgment on others. I live and let live. The law of cause and effect, as described by the Buddha, will determine the consequences of our actions.As far as the Buddhist precepts are concerned, yes, homosexuality violates the non-deviant sex precept. It also violates the laws of nature: the natural yin and yang if you will, whether or not one believes in the Buddha’s teachings.The consequences vary with the degrees of violation. On the other hand, one can perform Buddhist repentances to lessen the degrees of severity.​The good news is that if one really likes to do something about it, one can cultivate according to Buddhist practices to eliminate the problem. More specifically, if one can build one’s samadhi power to higher levels, then sexual desire will eventually wane until it disappears naturally."},{"title":"Six Chars Mantra","content":"​Question:Dear Venerable Ones,​I was reading the Kāraṇḍavyūhaḥ sutra or the Buddha speaks of Mahayana Sublime Treasure King sutra as it is known in English and come across the part where a Bodhisattva was requesting the Buddha to teach him the Six Words Great Enlightening Dharani (Om Mani Padme Hum).       ​The Buddha responds that this dharani is difficult to encounter and that even the innumerable Buddhas do not know where it is gained from. And later on, the Buddha recounts how in the past he went to meet innumerable Buddhas to find this dharani but was unable to until he met a Buddha who received the dharani from Guan yin in the distant past. Because of this I have some questions:1. How can Buddhas not know certain dharmas or where they come from? I was under the impression that Buddhas are omniscient.2. Is this a special dharma peculiar to Guan Yin only? Is he the only one that can allow its transmission? Is that why many Buddhas do not teach it?​I hope the Venerable Ones will be compassionate and help me resolve my doubts.   Answer:I am not familiar with the Sutra you mentioned. It seems to be from the Pali canon which is different from my source of information: the Sanskrit canon.Furthermore, I am not sure about the accuracy of the translation. I was very lucky to learn from English translations of Mahayana that were certified by my Chinese Master, Ven. Xuan Hua.Allow me to briefly offer my humble and limited views:The story in the quoted sutra seems illogical. How must a Buddha receive transmission of that mantra from a Bodhisattva? Bodhisattvas are disciples of the Buddhas. They are taught everything they know by the Buddhas. That is how they become Buddhas.In fact, based on my Mahayana Chinese sources, that mantra was taught to Guan Yin Bodhisattva by a Buddha which enabled him to instantly become enlightened.Yes, all Buddhas are omniscient. There is nothing they do not know.Buddhas transmit Dharmas that are appropriate for the recipients.There are more inconsistencies in your sutra that would lead me to greatly question its accuracy."},{"title":"Great Compassion Mantra and Hands & Eyes","content":"Question:​The Master indicated that reciting the Great Compassion Mantra without practicing the Hands & Eyes Dharma is not beneficial.

Master:​I became a newly minted Buddhist disciple a few months ago. My parents and husband are good people but do not believe in the Buddha. After I took refuge with the Triple Jewel, I started encountering obstructions from my family. My husband would often take issue about the Buddha with me.      He asked why don’t I use my brains to make a fortune instead of reciting the Buddha’s name: how does that help me bring home bread? My own parents would scold me when I would give them advice, saying that I barely know about Buddhism and yet I would try to teach them how to live their lives. In particular, when our dog bit their enemy, I advised my parents to let go of their enmity and pay a visit to reconcile. My parents got real upset with me and gave me a tongue lashing. My husband threatened to burn my Buddhist books and scriptures. Also, my new boss at work would pick on me and cause me a lot of trouble.In order to avoid my parents and husband from creating additional offenses because of my cultivation, I decided to no longer recite sutras or recite the Buddha’s name at home. I only recite the Buddha’s name silently when I do not need to think. I also would sneak to the temple after work on the 14th and 30th days of the lunar month.However, I am very sad because I do not how much longer I will be able to bear this before I can obtain liberation, end suffering and obtain rebirth to the Pure Land. Recently, I considered leaving the home life in order to cultivate in peace, however my daughter is only two years old and still needs a mother. That’s why I decided to continue to endure my circumstances as I wait for conditions improve.I feel like I am sinking in the sea of suffering. I sincerely ask for your advice. What can I do to change my family’s attitude toward my cultivation? Please rescue me! I hope to hear from you soon.​NTDH   Answer:In the past several years of teaching, I have encountered quite a few similar situations like yours.Most of which are women receiving obstructions from their husbands. But there have been other instances as well. There was the man who only could sneak out to the temple when his Catholic wife was not paying attention. And there is the mother who is forbidden to practice vegetarianism or go to the temple by her own accomplished son and daughters.To you all, I offer my sincere sympathy.It is said that as soon as one resolves to cultivate, the obstructions would come with a vengeance, perhaps in order to test one’s resolve. Let me see how we can help address some of your concerns.First, I feel that you are very smart and have dealt with your situation pretty well. However, you are making the same mistake that many Buddhists make. Please stop giving advice and stop telling others what to do WHEN THEY DO NOT SINCERELY ASK FOR YOUR OPINION.In particular, even though you were right in advising your parents to drop their enmity toward their enemy, you should have not given such advice because, as you have discovered, it would engender a typical adverse reaction from them and others.Over all, your approach would indicate that you are quite intelligent and resourceful. What you need to understand is that the obstructions to your cultivation should be seen under two aspects:Repaying your past karmic debts to your family.The opportunity to practice the Buddhist Dharma of patience.First, based on the Law of Cause and Effect, you are being obstructed in your cultivation because you obstructed others in the past. Now you must endure the consequences. Therefore, the astute Buddhist learns to practice repentance such as bowing to the Buddha, bowing repentances such as the Great Compassion Repentance or Emperor Liang’s Repentance. Repenting will alleviate the retributions.Another way is to generate blessings on their behalf to more quickly pay off your past karmic debts. You can take advantage of “professional” help by going to a good Chinese temple and inquire about the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma in order to pay off your karmic debts to your family. There should be some information on that Dharma on our web site too in the sutra section as well as in the Q&A.Moreover, enduring the difficult circumstances directly repays our karmic debts.What I hear from you is that you are quite afflicted. I hope that you can find support and comfort from your temple. I hope that you understand that obstructions can be turned into opportunities to practice patience. Cultivation is fundamentally learning to patiently endure the circumstances and not lose faith and hope.May I ask you to use your resourcefulness and determination to continue to endure it? That would bring you closer to liberation and end suffering. Along with that, generate blessings, a lot of blessings on their behalf using the methods mentioned above, in order to help them eventually benefit from Buddhism. Once they have enough blessings or once you’ve paid off your karmic debts to them, they will automatically stop giving you trouble.Simultaneously, you should also learn to be grateful to them for allowing you to practice patience. Develop an attitude of compassion and understanding. They do not have the opportunity to experience the bliss and freedom from cultivation. Please work on your samadhi power and unfold your wisdom so that you can stop resenting them.Come and see me if you can and I’ll give you more advice."},{"title":"Child owes Triple Jewel","content":"​Question:Na mo Emituofo!Ven. Master:I am a Pure Land Buddhist practitioner. Yesterday, I met with another Buddhist who practices Secret School who gave me a pendant that has a silver globe with a long string with some kind of mantra, telling me that my young child (who is 2.5 years old) owes the Triple Jewel from past lives.      ​As a result, he will not be able to study well in school, will have a hard time making a living, will not be able to keep money and will waste all of his parents’ assets. This new Buddhist acquaintance advised me to go to the temple to find ways to pay down my child’s debt to the Triple Jewel; it seems that this individual wants no money from me and seems to only want to help me out.Is it possible to repay debts to the Triple Jewel? From what I know, a debt to the Triple Jewel is a very heavy burden. My family often makes offerings to liberate lives, print sutras, make images and statues and donates regularly to the sangha. Is there anything specific that I can do to help my child? We wish to cultivate to obtain liberation. If we are in serious debt then how can we possibly obtain liberation and end suffering?Please kindly instruct us on what to do.Thank you so much for your guidance.​DA   Answer:Please do not be anxious about these dire predictions about your child.In general, I tend to not take advice such as this seriously because it lacks specificity. For example, if that individual really knows your child’s situation then you should have been informed how much your child owes the Triple Jewel and how the debt occurred. Furthermore, if your child really owes the Triple Jewel then how can any mantra you recite and any pendant you receive be effective in reducing this damning karmic debt?Please do not accept freebies from strangers and do not use that mantra. Mantras should only be transmitted by a bona fide teacher, preferably from a reputable left home person especially because you are a Buddhist.However, you are right in wanting to take precautionary measures to help your child. Parents should consider helping their children by generating blessings on their behalf. This is preferable to giving money. In your case, in order to help provide more blessings and avert disasters, you could employ the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma. You could get more information about this Chinese approach that Vietnamese Buddhism does not have by reading up on the Medicine Master Sutra on our web site where we have a general explanation. This is not the typical “Cầu An (praying for welfare)” Dharma that the Vietnamese temples have. Rather, the Medicine Master Buddha plaque that the more competent Chinese temples have at their disposal, can help your child’s welfare, repay his past debts [be it to the Triple Jewel or to others], provide for life’s necessities, avert disasters, lengthen life, etc…I wholeheartedly agree with you that we should all strive to cultivate to obtain liberation. The smart Buddhist prefers to get out of the Reincarnation Wheel as soon as possible. One such expedient is to obtain rebirth to the Pure Lands as advocated by the various Pure Land practices.​Please refer to our explanation of the Amitabha Sutra that is available in Vietnamese on our web site. The English version should be available shortly. It will give you more insight on how to maximize your chances to obtain rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land as soon as possible."},{"title":"Hands and Eyes","content":"Question:For the past few days, I have been practicing the Hands & Eyes Dharma that I found on the internet but I have yet to see any results.Ven.

I often pray that if I pass my test, then I’d eat vegetarian in order to show my gratitude. Everything I pray for all came through. Should I follow through with eating vegetarian?​TTĐ       Answer:Congratulations in obtaining your wishes.First of all, in the Buddhist way of looking at things, if you made a promise, then you must keep it. If you don’t, they (meaning the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas) probably won’t take anything away from you, but don’t expect much help the next time around.​Furthermore, eating vegetarian is very healthy and compassionate. We’re showing our respect for living beings when we don’t eat them. Try it for a while and find out for yourself. Initially, you’ll have to face your friends and family’s objections and concerns: they’ll say that you aren’t getting enough protein, or you just want to draw attention to yourself, etc. Of course, almost all of their objections are wrong .

You could also switch to reciting the Amitabha Sutra instead because you can then eventually be able to recite both that sutra and the mantra from memory. You’ll create similar merit and virtue.2. I recommend that after your daily practice, you chould recite the following to dedicate the merit and virtue, in any language of your preference:I DEDICATE THE MERIT AND VIRTUE FROM CULTIVATION功 德 殊 勝 行◎,Gōng dé shū shèng héng,Tu Hành công đức thù thắng hạnh,WITH ALL ITS SUPERIOR, LIMITLESS BLESSINGS,無 邊 勝 福 皆 迴 向.Wú biān shèng fú jiē huí xiàng.Vô biên thắng phước giai hồi-hướng.WITH THE UNIVERSAL VOW THAT ALL LIVING BEINGS SUNK IN DEFILEMENT,普 願 沉 溺 諸 衆 生,Pǔ yüàn chén nì zhū zhòng shēng,Phổ nguyện trầm nê chư chúng sanh,WILL QUICKLY GO TO THE LAND OF THE BUDDHA OF LIMITLESS LIGHT速 往 無 量 光 佛 剎.Sù wǎng wú liàng guāng Fó chà.Tốc vãng Vô Lượng Quang Phật Sát.ALL BUDDHAS OF THE TEN DIRECTIONS AND THREE PERIODS OF TIME十 方 三 世 一 切 佛◎Shí fāng sān shì yí qiè FóThập phương tam thế nhất thiết PhậtALL BODHISATTVAS, MAHASATTVAS一 切 菩 薩 摩 訶 薩Yí qiè Pú Sà Mó Hē SàNhất thiết Bồ Tát Ma Ha TátMAHA PRAJNA PARAMITA!摩 訶 般 若 波 羅 蜜◎!Mó Hē Bō Rě Bō Luó Mì!Ma Ha Bát Nhã Ba La Mật!Afterwards, you can dedicate the merit and virtue to your family and relatives.​3. It’s most excellent to bow repentances. You could bow the Great Compassion Repentance or the Ten Thousand Buddhas Repentance [the latter is only available in Chinese and Vietnamese]. Please call the temple directly to ask for specific instructions."},{"title":"Great Compassion Mantra for Autistic","content":"​Question:Ven. Master:I have a nine year old son who is autistic. I have been reciting the Great Compassion mantra and the Buddha’s name. Please kindly teach me how recite them properly. I currently live in Houston, TX and heard about the Great Compassion mantra Dharma from listening to a Dharma Talk from Great Master Xuan Hua.​BN      Answer:It’s not easy to take care of a child who has autism.First, it’s beneficial to recite the Great Compassion mantra and the Buddha’s name. Make sure to dedicate the merit and virtue on his behalf.Traditionally, it’s better to receive transmission of that mantra before practicing it. Since you have affinity with Great Master Xuan Hua, you should go to a temple of his or his disciples to ask for transmission of that mantra. It’ll help with your recitation. They could also give you more advice on how to maintain mantras as well.Furthermore, you should consider getting spiritual help for your child. You have exhausted medical help. It’s time to explore more spiritual help. While reciting the Great Compassion mantra is helpful, you may want to consider external help: professional help could be of immense value to you.​For example, the Chinese have the Medicine Master Dharma that will greatly benefit your child. You could get more information on the Medicine Master Sutra on our web site. Getting a Medicine Buddha plaque for the family will provide more protection and quicker debt repayment to your creditors who are clearly creating problems to your family through your son."},{"title":"Theravada Hinayana, Pure Land Mahayana","content":"​Question:Ven. Master,Allow me to ask a question about Buddhism.​I had the chance to meet with my previous teaching monks and nuns. They informed me that they follow the Theravadan tradition. When I inquired whether or not it belongs to Hinayana, they answered that it is not. I am still unsatisfied about that answer and that is why I have to ask for your input.       I just watched your TV program called Pure Land Mahayana in which the co-host, Mr. Thien Giac and you were explaining about repaying kindness.1. Is there any difference in practice between the Theravada tradition and Hinayana?2. Is there any difference in practice between the Vietnamese Pure Land Mahayana and Chinese Pure Land Mahayana?I am grateful to you for helping understand more about Buddhism [through your TV programs and web sites].I wish you peace and bliss in bringing Mahayana to living beings.​DN  Answer:As far as I know, the Theravadan tradition is just another name for Hinayana.As far as practices go, they are based on Hinayana sacred scriptures which were originally recorded in Pali. People can say all they want, if they use Pali based scriptures, then it’s Hinayana.Right now, I see little differences in practice between the Vietnamese and Chinese Pure Land Mahayana because both are basically based on Chinese Pure Land Buddhism. Unfortunately, it has evolved a very narrow interpretation of Pure Land Buddhism.I feel that Pure Land Buddhism as it is practiced right now could be improved so as to maximize the rebirth chances of its believers. That is why we call our approach Pure Land Mahayana."},{"title":"Skandha Demon","content":"​Question:Ven. Master,First of all, I wish you and the venerable sangha health, peace and bliss.​I left the home life 10 years ago and am practicing Chan. I am vigorously practicing in order to develop samadhi power. My teacher passed away a few years ago. I am currently practicing by myself and worry that the skandha demons will come to destroy all of these years of gongfu training.       A venerable monk gave me documentation on the skandha demons in order for me to find insight and not fall into their traps. But I am unsure about the accuracy of this document. Please kindly provide me guidance so that I can have peace of mind when I use this information in my continued practice.Amituofo,​DH  ​Answer:Thank you for your kindness.I applaud your sincerity and vigor. That being said, I am concerned for you as it is not a good idea to practice Chan by yourself because you need the proper protection and guidance in order to resolve your obstructions and difficulties.May I point out to you that you could be meditating for another 20 years and still be stuck. I have encountered too many left home people such as yourself. If they had practiced under a competent teacher, they would have been much better off.It is true that all cultivators will have to deal with the skandha demons at some point. While the venerable sanghan was kind to you in giving you the documentation, I tend to disagree with this approach. Instead, I would like to advise you to seek a competent teacher.I tend to dismiss these kind of materials as not helpful because of the overall nature of the advice. And frankly, I do not have the time to go over the entire document word by word to attest to its accuracy.As far as I know, Great Master Xuan Hua of the DRBA authored a book explaining the 50 Skandha Demons. I’ve read both the English and Chinese versions and have found them to be extremely helpful. I don’t know whether or not his disciples have translated it into Vietnamese, but you could easily inquire by contacting them via their website. I have not read the Vietnamese version and do not intend to, and therefore I cannot attest to its accuracy.​It is my hope that you will realize the importance of finding a competent teacher in your community to assist you. I wish you the very best."},{"title":"Five Rebellious","content":"Question:​I am an adherent of the Reciting the Buddha’s Name School. I have not yet taken refuge but is it possible to receive the Five Precepts? Right now, I try to observe the Five Precepts. I started a relationship before I decided to observe the precepts and I am afraid that I still occasionally violate the Deviant Sex Precept. What should I do? Please kindly give me your advice.       ​Furthermore, I have a temper. I am fully aware of my temperament and try to control myself but I sometimes get into big arguments with my mother. I invariably feel very guilty afterwards, and sincerely repent: I continuously recite the Buddha’s name but I still feel uneasy because I fear violating the Five Rebellious Offenses. I still feel very badly about it.​NHB  Answer:One must take refuge with the Triple Jewel before taking the Precepts.Since you are already reciting the Buddha’s name, you definitely should take refuge as soon as possible in order to receive the Buddha’s protection and guidance.Should you decide to take Precepts, you should make sure to receive them from places that explain them and guide you on how to practice them. To take refuge and receive precepts will help you generate even more blessings that will greatly benefit your recitation.Since you have not received the Precepts, you are not violating them when you have sexual intercourse with your girlfriend. More specifically, you can selectively receive the precepts that you can keep.​It is good that you understand that one must control one’s temper. It’s important to avoid arguing with your mother for the sake of being filial and keeping the peace in your home. However, even if you do, you are not violating the Five Rebellious Offenses, among which one may not kill one’s parents."},{"title":"Broken Statues","content":"Question:Ven. Master,I have a number of statues of the Buddha and of GuanYin Bodhisattva that are damaged. They were gifts from friends and acquaintances. Please advise me as to what to do with them.I wish you peace and bliss,​MN      Answer:It is a very good idea to try to repair them because it is just as meritorious as creating new images or statues. The associated blessings are inconceivable.If you can’t repair them then you can pass them on to people who can.If you can’t find people who can make repairs, then you could put them up on altars and make offerings to them. For example, I heard of the story of someone who has a faded picture of the Buddha. He refused to dispose of it and put it up on the altar to make offerings to it. One day, he looked up and saw that the picture had restored itself. Similar responses can occur if we are sincere.​If you prefer to not put them on altars then you should put them away somewhere, in an area that is clean, until they naturally disintegrate. To intentionally destroy them is equivalent to shedding the Buddha’s blood, which should be avoided by any means."},{"title":"Family Discord","content":"Question:Master,When we are in disagreement, we tend to get into arguments. How can we maintain harmony in our family when everyone insists on being right?​AV      Answer:Like many newlyweds, people usually go through a trying period when they first co-habit. Things tend not to be as pleasant as during courtship.We have a most insightful discussion about this topic during our morning Dharma Talk dated 1/15/12 during which many of students shared their personal experience and talked about how they managed to make their marriage work. Please listen to it to get more details.For the sake of our reader, I’ll provide two salient points:When two people have strong beliefs and opinions, the only way to resolve it for one person to yield. Are you willing to yield to her even though you know that she is wrong? If you truly love her, then you must resolve to take a loss and yield when she is wrong. One must also learn to love when the other person is wrong.Yielding is to “repay our karmic debts”. The more quickly you pay up, the quicker you’ll have harmony in the family."},{"title":"Flesh Bodhisattvas","content":"Question:Dear Master,​I’ve been reading Master Hsuan Hua’s book, “Words of Wisdom, Beginning Buddhism” and have just finished the chapter about How to Repay the Kindness of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and I am very curious about them living in our Saha world. Could I please ask you these questions:      ​1. At first I didn’t believe that they actually were here in the world, and then I came to realize that’s what Master Hsuan Hua is saying. Would they appear different from us? Would we know one if we saw one? I think that they would not want to be known to others.2. Do they have some kind of protection that shields their true nature from others?3. You mentioned once during a lecture that although they come back to the world, that in their current life, they are just ordinary people and they themselves don’t know who they are. Then, how do they find their true nature?4. I would think they would want to accept themselves, but I wonder, sometimes could it happen that they don’t accept their true nature?I look forward to your thoughts and guidance. Please feel free to share my questions with the assembly or askbli if you think it would be helpful to others.Many thanks,Emituofo,​VS   Answer:1. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas could appear in the world in the form of response bodies. For example, a Bodhisattva could be cultivating in the Western Bliss Pure Land. Let’s say that conditions have ripened such that Amitabha will remind the Bodhisattva to be reborn to our Saha world again in order to draw near and save his husband from a former life. In this case, he goes through birth like a regular human being. Ordinary people will not be able to recognize them. There are a lot of people such as this in our world right now.2. Another possible scenario is that they only manifest temporarily like a reflection of the moon on the water surface to teach and then leave. A multitude of such examples abound in the Buddhist folklore where Bodhisattvas come to our world as lay people or left home people. They are never confused because they do not go through birth and death.3. Under the above scenario of #1, these already enlightened beings have nothing to worry about. For example, they grow up and eventually encounter a Buddhist teacher, cultivate and eventually become enlightened in our world. They could then leave the home life and teach the Dharma. I believe Master Xuan Hua belongs to this category.4. Once enlightened, always enlightened.​That is why we advocate trying to obtain rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land and not come back before you are enlightened over there. Should they come back like in scenario #1, they are so blessed that they may be initially confused through the birth process but they are no longer confused by the time they die, meaning that they will be able to successfully carry out their plans or fulfill their past vows."},{"title":"I am weak","content":"Question:Master, please help me with the following:​1. You explained that “everyone insists on being right”. Then when we are right and others are wrong, what should we do? If they are in the wrong and if we don’t prove it to them, then aren’t they continuing to err? How should I behave in those circumstances? Usually, people try to explain once to those who are wrong and then give up if they don’t get it. Personally, I’d try to explain once or twice before I remain silent and let them decide for themselves. Is that OK?      2. I often pity others. When I see them suffer I feel very sad even though there is little that I can do for them. Sometimes there are some who hurt me but if I see that they are suffering, then I yield to them. This makes me indecisive and wishy-washy in my relationships. Please teach me how I can stop this kind of behavior that shows a weakness in character.​NL  Answer:I’ll try but you have to promise me to stop thinking that I know everything:1. You should stop trying to convince others that you’re right, especially when they are wrong. For example, if your father is wrong, what makes you qualified to tell him he’s wrong?As a rule of thumb, you should refrain from telling others your opinion unless they sincerely ask for it three times. This is out of profound respect for them. Everyone deserves the right to suffer and insist on suffering, especially when they are wrong. Let’s not meddle in their karmic retributions.Instead, you may want to switch to being supportive of their wrong decisions and try to be there for them when they are at the end of their rope. Only then may they be more receptive to changes and to your advice.2. Your compassion is most commendable. I see nothing wrong in yielding to others at all. I’d rather be weak and good than strong but un-compassionate.​On the other hand, if you really want to help others, then dedicate your life to that pursuit. Go acquire skills that can truly help relieve others’ suffering. I must warn you that in order to become skilled in helping others, you yourself must be prepared to suffer greatly: you must be prepared to give up what’s most important to you before you can muster the strength of character and unfold true wisdom to help others."},{"title":"Messy Bow","content":"Question:Master,I plan to bow to the Ten Thousand Buddhas Repentance. I shared my intention to my mother who indicated that she too would like to do it. However, she felt that since we have crampy and quite untidy quarters, she is afraid that it lacks the proper adornments and thus respectfulness towards all those many Buddhas. Could you teach us how to properly bow this repentance?​NL      Answer:Your mother is right in showing reluctance to bow to the repentance. If she feels that strongly about it then please do not go against her wishes.You could go outside and bow to Shakyamuni Buddha 10,000 times too. Great Master Xuan Hua used to bow outside of his parents’ house too.​Personally, I feel that it’s more important for our mind to be most respectful when bowing. In that case, the environment bears little consequences: you are not creating offenses at all. In contrast, people who bow to the Buddhas in the most adorned Buddha Halls and yet fail to be respectful are in worse shape."},{"title":"Medicine Master Buddha","content":"Question:Dear Master,How are you doing?​I’m reading your Medicine Master Sutra slowly, hoping to absorb your teachings at a deeper level. I planned to ask all my questions upon finishing the book but I already have so many, that I hope you don’t mind that I ask as I go along.       1. Will the person who is praying for the benefit of another incur any sickness when transferring the merits and virtues to the patient because he is interfering with the debtors’ business?2. Must the beneficiary of the Medicine Master Buddha plaque believe in Buddhism and in this particular dharma in order to enjoy the benefits? Besides the offering procedure, are there any other requirements needed to request this efficacious plaque?3. In reference to your story about a nun who healed illnesses by using water that had been purified with sacred mantras, I learned that she often got sick for getting into the creditors way. As I understand it, you won’t encounter the same consequences when practicing the Medicine Master Dharma. What is the difference between you and that nun? Isn’t it the type of dharma being practiced and the Samadhi power of the practitioner that makes a difference?4. Will you be suffering gravely from illnesses like Master Xuan Hua did at the end of your life if you continue practicing the Medicine Master Dharma? Did Master Xuan Hua practice this dharma to help his patients while he was still in this world?5. Somewhere in the book you advised us not to interfere with other people’s business. However, Master Xuan Hua did it. Was it because he was free from life and death before he took action? He must have had some type of Samadhi power or great dharmas to back him up.I’ve been thinking about these questions for some time now but previously I didn’t know how to express my thoughts and along with that, I had my doubts that they were even worthy to mention. But your book on this sutra has given me the courage to ask. Please kindly teach me so that I can understand more about this dharma. Thanks for your help!​TNQ  Answer:Please feel free to send your questions as they arise. We will attempt to address them as time permits.1. To transfer merit and virtue to the sick is to meddle into his affairs. Therefore there is a price to pay for meddling. One could incur illnesses, whether they manifest or not. Or one will not be sick, say because the creditor owes one to you.2. The recipient does not need to believe in Buddhism. In general, the Medicine Master Buddha Buddha plaque Dharma can be used to generate blessings that can repay the past debts instead of having to repay them through suffering or illness. When requesting the plaque, the more sincere you are, the more blessings will be generated to repay past debts.Speaking of the effectiveness, there is nothing definite.For example, in the case of extreme sincerity such as making great donations to the Triple Jewel, this action will result in curing the most incurable illnesses. This is explained in the Earth Store Sutra. We hope to be able to make it available next year.Another aspect is the behavior of the debtor. If he is immoral then there is less effectiveness. For instance, there is little progress if the drug addict continues to take drugs while going through a treatment program. Or perhaps, there are some who are quite astute. Instead of paying great amounts for surgery and medical treatments, they’d rather invest in a plaque because it costs so much less. If such are the only conditions, wouldn’t our intervention be detrimental to the medical professions of the world?Buddhism is to help everyone. We do not impose our will or oppress any living being. Think about it: if we give protection to only those who are ill, then who will protect the creditors? We must be fair to all, and seek to resolve the matters in a way that is amicable and beneficial to everyone involved.Dharma power is clearly an important factor. The stronger ones will be able to help more. That is why we cultivate vigorously to develop the Dharma power to aid others.In general, the Medicine Master Buddha Buddha plaque Dharma can be used to address a multitude of problems and difficulties as elaborated in the Sutra. However, sometimes before we can get to the king, we must first go through his generals and lieutenants, and that takes time. Regardless, that Dharma gradually generates blessings to resolve difficulties and extend life.The reason we still make this Dharma available is because it has become increasingly effective for more people over the years. Some benefits particular to this Dharma of the Mahayana School are not found elsewhere such as blessings to quell disasters and prolong life. These types of blessings carry no bad consequences, bring about great benefits for this life as well as transcendental benefits.In truth, at times, the Dharma may not be able to help immediately; not because it lacks power but because proper conditions are lacking. In the Amitabha Sutra, Ven. Xuan Hua related on how he was not able to cross over a bee colony turned human but had to ask Mahamaudgalyayana to help.3. If we incur debts then we should pay it off willingly. To aid healing others’ sickness will result in one having to bear the consequences. For example, if I brag and exaggerate my ability to heal others in order to become more famous and receive more offerings then I definitely will have to pay dearly because of my greed.Each person is different. Our policy is to protect those who come to us to request for help. This is my aspiration. Otherwise, who would dare come to us for help?4. In my humble opinion, Great Master Xuan Hua manifested severe illnesses in order to remind his disciples not to meddle into others’ affairs before they can fully understand the consequences of their actions. He had in his possession, a multitude of Dharmas that he used depending on the conditions.I have great admiration for him. Therefore I choose to imitate his conduct and am prepared to incur problems and difficulties in order to help others. You should not do it because you are not ready to bear the consequences. For example, if you still discriminate between benefit and loss, then you should not. Or if you complain and have regrets after helping others, then you should not. Or if you help others and expect gratitude or reward, then you should not, etc…​5. My advice is applicable to those who are not Buddhas yet, especially those who are not yet enlightened. Great Master Xuan Hua is a great Bodhisattva. He is an exception."},{"title":"Possessed","content":"Question:I hear that within a buffer zone of a few hundred meters, the ghosts and spirits cannot encroach. Why is that in a number of Vietnamese temples, there are Buddhist disciples or left home people who are possessed by yin beings, rendering intelligible when speaking, or sometimes they enter spasms… How can these situations addressed?​N      Answer:Not necessarily all Way places are like that. Usually Way places are protected when there are cultivators present.​Furthermore, yin beings are allowed to enter our temple if they obey the rules and behave themselves. It’s too complicated to cursively explain how to address these types of possession problems. Should there be specific problems for specific individuals, then you should personally come to a Good Knowing Adviser for instructions."},{"title":"Samadhi & Astral Body","content":"Question:Master and venerated Good Knowing Advisers:I am a lay person who does not understand the various samadhi levels and certifications.

A year later, I begin to be able to see things when my soul leaves my body, reaching heights. And I can also see bright lights during the day as well as at night time.What level of samadhi is this? Please elaborate.​NX       Answer:To have an astral body leave the body is quite common with mediators. If that happens frequently then you may want to consider seeking a Good Knowing Adviser to ask for guidance.It takes no real significant samadhi level to have an astral body or see light. You should not be overly attached.Unfortunately, I cannot elaborate any more because this belongs the realm of the Dharma of Seeking for instructions from a Good Knowing Adviser.Seeking help from a Good Knowing Adviser is a way to express our sincerity and therefore requires you to come and make the request in person. It cannot be done via mail or indirectly. In some cases, even when you personally come and request for instructions and fail to prove your sincerity, you will not be instructed. That happened to me personally: I came from thousands of miles for instructions and left empty handed.When I certified the samadhi level of my students, that was done because of great conditions matured. It was not a casual thing. Unfortunately, many of my students still fail to understand that it is a great gift: so many cultivators devote their entire lifetime to cultivation and yet not know what level of samadhi they have reached.​I wish you the best luck in finding a competent Good Knowing Adviser to provide guidance."},{"title":"Abandon Family – Follow up","content":"Question:Ven. Master,Before allowing people to leave the home life, do you check their family situation? Does the family agree with her? Is the husband able to support the family? What if they can’t support the children’s tuition and fees, mortgage payments, or car payments? The children cry because they miss their mother. The husband suffers so much. Can one thus attain the fruition? Please answer in a straightforward manner.​TH      Answer:Correction:In the Roman Catholic Church, women who have been married and have been mothers are allowed to become nuns if they are widows. If a woman has been divorced and wants to become a nun, she must go through a religious evaluation process for her marriage to be annulled.This means that the marriage, which is a sacramental contract between two people and God, is dissolved. If she receives an annulment, then she can become a nun. This is also true for a man if he wants to become a priest, monk, or brother.However, if there are children involved, their care takes priority over all. The divorced or widowed mother or father must wait until the children reach adulthood. They must complete their parental responsibility before they can be considered for religious life. Each religious order or community might have their own rules on this and there might be exceptions, but this is the basic philosophy for all.We apologize to our readers that we didn’t answer this question correctly."},{"title":"Donation to Lotus Sutra","content":"Question:Na Mo Emituofo.Master, I made a vow when I was younger to make offerings to the Lotus Sutra. Now that I have grown up and conditions have matured to fulfill my childhood vow, could you please give addresses of temples or pure abodes that are in need and whose assembly often recites the Lotus Sutra so that I can come and make offerings to them?​Thank you very much.      Answer:It’s very kind of you to decide to support those who cultivate the Dharma Flower/Lotus Sutra. I still remember how difficult it was to lack resources such as sutras to use in cultivation.Unfortunately, I do not know of specific Way places in need.If I may offer my two cents worth, you might want to instead concentrate on Way places that have serious cultivators who are practicing Mahayana. This is consistent with your desire to make offerings to the Lotus Sutra because it is one of the three Mahayana Sutras. Good cultivators need support in order to practice these Mahayana Dharmas. As such, you can make regular offerings to the various Mahayana temples where there are true cultivators. I unfortunately cannot make public recommendations because I try to avoid publicly favoring one temple over another. Nor do I wish my senior sanghans to scold me for still harboring a discriminating mind.Furthermore, you may also want to focus on making offerings to print good and accurate translations of Mahayana sutras. I can be specific on this, most of the Vietnamese translations of the Sutras are inaccurate because even though the translators understand the words or language, they do not quite understand the Dharma they translate. Therefore, you should ask the “experts” who explain and translate sutras to make recommendations. I am not qualified since I am but a small time monk who lacks wisdom.Finally, I applaud your sincerity.

Master,I am a Buddhist disciple. I have never heard any left home person teach people to abandon their family, their husband and children to leave the home life. Do you feel that your teaching is appropriate? I asked a lot of monks and nuns. Which sutra do you base such teaching?​TH      Answer:Had you broadened your research a little more to other religions, you would have found that, for example, the Catholics have married women and mothers amongst their nuns. I do not believe that their scriptures forbid married people from becoming monastics.Similarly, there are no Buddhist scriptures that forbid married women from becoming nuns. For example, the Buddha’s wife and even his aunt later became nuns while his father was still alive.If you turn the matter around, perhaps it is because religions do not discriminate against married people.Furthermore, had you talked to more left home people, you would have found out that a lot of married people did leave the home life in the history of Buddhism.I apologize if this offends you personally because you seem to be.May I suggest that if you look at the Buddhist teaching: “If there is gathering then there is separation”? Is there any party or celebration that does not come to an end?If you had listened to my other lectures, you might have run into more information on the topic.Fundamentally, one stays married because of conditions. Similarly, one gets divorced because of conditions. One also leaves the home life because of conditions. The overwhelming majority of married women who would like to become nuns cannot leave the home life because conditions do not permit.Personally, I believe in the individual choice to live life as one feels that it has meaning.

Continue to live as I am presently: go to college, get married and plan for raising a family or a career like ordinary people. I can go to the temple as often as I like because it’s my decision.​2. I can do as I please after my father passes away. Until then, I may not leave the home life.      3. If I insist on leaving the home life, then he will renounce me and will no longer consider me as his daughter. I can move away from home and do as I please [I’ll get evicted from under the family roof] and then he no longer wants to see me. He feels that he went through so much hardship to sponsor me to come here from Vietnam [3 years ago]. Once I got here, I did nothing to enjoy the better life and instead wanted to leave the home life: What is the point of coming to America? Now that our family is reunited here, I then decide to leave and break it up: he cannot accept such decision.My father is very opinionated and will not listen to anyone once he’s convinced that he’s right. He feels that Buddhism is too abstract and that my using it to help him is ineffective and meaningless and that he does need not need my help in any fashion.I still wish to leave the home life but my father’s position makes me very sad and afflicted. These past few days back home have been very unpleasant because I know that I am the reason for his unhappiness. My weakness is that I do not want to make others unhappy. I am trying to work on my weakness but have not been able to do much. For my entire life [ I am in my late twenties], I’ve always listened to his advice except for when I chose my fiancé [which was against his will as well as the family’s wishes].May I look at you as my second father? If you agree then please never hesitate to point out my mistakes or teach me. I like criticism because it gives me opportunity to look at my flaws.I am incapable of convincing my father [ The rest of my family is OK with my leaving the home life]. What should I do?​NL  Answer:This is such a beautiful love story. You are so fortunate because your family is so fond and attached to you. Let me clarify the mindset behind his three choices:1. Unlike your mother whom he derides for going to the temple, your father makes a special exemption for you. Perhaps, he feels that at least you should have the opportunity to experience spirituality before your future husband may decide to prevent you from doing so like he’s doing to your mother.2. As long as he is alive, he wants you to be happy. I am sure that if you make wrong choices and become unhappy, he’ll be there to shoulder the burden until the day he dies. That makes me feel mushy, still.3. They went through a lot of trouble to sponsor you here from Vietnam three years ago. And yet, now you want to break up the family by leaving the home life. In his eyes, you are a little home wrecker. How could you reject his love for you by severing the family ties? He’d rather make a preemptive strike in order to protect his own hurt feelings because you dare reject his unconditional love for you.This is not unusual because it takes a while before the family attachments and ties can be effectively resolved. They can be. I’ll talk to you in person to make suggestions that I will not publish for obvious reasons of privacy and effective problem-resolution.I decided to publish the remaining part because I often witness this type of problem.It happens frequently with the Asian families.Someday, I wish that the Asian parents in America will wake up and realize that in this new world, they are supposed to allow their children to explore and live their lives the way they see fit once they become of legal age.Unfortunately, the Asian parents place so much emphasis and pride on the success of their children that they put undue pressure on them. That could have serious consequences that could be handed down to future generations and thus create a tradition of meddling and causing unhappiness to their children and descendants.For example, I feel that the Asian Yale law professor who wrote “The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother” is so misguided. The Asians’ tradition of getting pride from their children’s achievements should stay in Asia. I feel America’s culture is much better for the children’s development. I hope that the readers will not read “irresponsibility” in this. Rather, parents of all nationalities should encourage their children to explore and make mistakes. Making mistakes builds character and develops wisdom. Only experiencing success tends to make one dependent on continued success and become arrogant.Going back to this father, I really like this man because he truly and deeply loves his daughter. Unfortunately, when you are like that, you lack clarity of mind.As far as I am concerned, this father’s refusal to grant permission for her to leave the home life is because he cannot handle her rejection of his love. How could she even consider severing her emotional ties to him? At least, if she ever gets married, she is still his daughter. However, if she becomes a nun, there is no more father and daughter relationship as per his understanding of the Buddhist tradition. Leaving the home life is the ultimate act of filial piety.To all the fathers of the world, I advise you all to learn a better way to love your children.It is far better to allow your children to choose their own path and be there for them regardless, especially when they get in trouble. Even though let’s say you believe that your daughter is making a serious mistake, you still love and respect her so much that you are prepared to suffer with her mistakes. This is the greater love than only worrying about yourself getting hurt because you can’t stand watching her getting hurt.That is what we call in Buddhism, selfish love. Most of the so-called “conditional love” that I often hear about is really just selfish love. It’s just fear of oneself not being able to bear it when one’s beloved children get hurt.​Greater love would have room to allow one to get hurt privately while shouldering the children’s pains. That’s right. Parents are supposed to get the double whammy when the children are hurt. That is part of better parenting."},{"title":"Sick when attending recitation sessions","content":"Question:Master:Our Way place has a lot of members. That is why we often have to participate and recite on behalf of the members’ deceased family and relatives.Does reciting continuously for 8 hours really help?Each time I go, I’d fall sick. Is it because of the excessive yin qi?What can we do to avoid having problems when we recite for others? We can’t say no.​NN      Answer:​The more you recite the better it is because more merit and virtue is created on behalf of the deceased. There is really no magic regarding the 8 hours. What’s important is to create blessings within the 49 days period."},{"title":"Alcoholic Medicine","content":"Question:Master:​For those who received the Five Precepts, if medicine contains alcohol or using drops of alcohol for preventative purposes (long term dosage: four drops each time), is that violating precepts?       Answer:Alcohol used in the preparation of medicine is part of the exception to the precepts: there is no infraction.​Using alcohol as medicine in tiny amounts for preventative purposes is also exempt. However, I have great reservations of the effectiveness of such medicine. Most medications typically have similarly effective ingredients that are non-alcoholic."},{"title":"[PLHB] Past creditors","content":"Question:Are our external wounds the result of past karmic retributions?​Each time I focus on reciting the Buddha’s name, many obstructions would arise. Someone suggested that I should accord with conditions and dedicate the merit and virtue to the Past Creditors. How I can succeed in my practice?      Answer:That’s correct, getting wounded is the result of retributions from past karmas.When we recite the Buddha’s name or cultivate in general, there will be obstructions and difficulties. They can be classified as:1. Karmic obstructions: For example, lifting a heavy object is not easy.2. Retribution obstructions: Such as we obstructed others in the past. How we undergo the retribution of being obstructed. This belongs to the “Past Creditors” category.3. Affliction obstructions: Although the obstruction is not significant but we get afflicted and give up.I am not clear on “according with conditions”. The advice is a bit fuzzy to me. You should clarify it with the adviser.When you encounter obstructions while cultivating, you should learn to endure patiently. Why are you complaining? Without obstructions, how can you make progress? It’s just like at school, can you obtain a degree without taking tests?​If you meet with a GKA then you’ll be directed on how to resolve your obstructions in order to bring you to your end goal. Each obstruction must resolved according to its specificity. It cannot be generalized."},{"title":"[PLHB] Using the recitation beads while talking","content":"Question:​I use the recitation beads and recite the Buddha’s name while talking or listening the the Dharma. Is that appropriate?       Answer:Using the recitation beads is a very good way to remind oneself to recite the Buddha’s name.However, you should not imitate others in using the recitation beads like a monkey.The actual method is to concentrate, each time you recite the Buddha’s name, that is when you push one bead. The objective is to make it become automatic: you push one bead corresponds to your reciting the Buddha’s name once. It should not be the case that your hand pushes a bead but your mind does not recite the Buddha’s name.If such is your skill level, then it is OK to use the bead while talking, walking, or listening to the Dharma as long as each bead results in one recitation.Personally, I prefer not to use the beads because it tells the whole world that I am reciting the Buddha’s name. I prefer not to draw attention to myself.​I prefer to cultivate discreetly without advertising it. To cultivate means that we do what others are doing: we can blend in."},{"title":"[PLHB] Abortion","content":"Question:​I had an abortion, how should I recite the Earth Store Sutra and dedicate the merit and virtue to help?      Answer:When we have abortions, they tend to have a hard time separating from us because:They are attached to their mother.They have hatred for their mother for taking their lives.Therefore, we should generate blessings in order to help them obtain liberation.Reciting the Earth Store Sutra is very effective at helping them attain liberation from the Three Evil Paths. You could recite the Earth Store Sutra three times and dedicate the merit and virtue to them.Better yet, you should request a rebirth plaque on their behalf so as to help them obtain rebirth to the Western Bliss Pure Land."},{"title":"[PLHB] Manifestations while reciting","content":"Question:​In the evening, when I recite the Buddha’s name, there often are strange occurrences. Why is that so?       Answer:Those are from the invisible beings who manifest or make their own presence felt.Reciting the Buddha’s name creates a lot of merit and virtue for living beings in the area. Therefore, some of them may manifest to express gratitude or laud the good deed.When they get to hear the Buddha’s name, the seeds are registered into their Alaya consciousness which will offer them a chance for rebirth to Amitabha Buddha’s Pure Land in the future.For instance, someone had many abortions in her younger days.Consequently, she has been constantly tormented and felt oppressed.“They” seem to generate a lot of noise and disturbances in the mind. She once turned on our recitation of the Buddha’s name and suddenly, “they” stopped making noises. She further felt like her arms are being caressed. She then told “them” to behave in order for the master to consent to help get them to the Pure Land. “They” since behaved.​Not only are we sharing space with those invisible beings, they often come and manifest in order to ask us to help them attain liberation or rebirth to the Pure Land."},{"title":"Criticized Vegetarian","content":"Question:Master:This is the first time I had access your web site. That’s why I asked the questions at the wrong places.I’d like to know how to repay my karmic debts this lifetime so that I’ll be free and won’t have to repay in future lifetimes.I prayed and decided to become vegetarian last September. I still cook non-vegetarian for my husband and children. I wonder when my karmic debts will be eradicated because my husband is very critical and is vehemently opposed to my new diet.​DN       Answer:It is good to bring forth the mind of repentance.We all have been creating offenses since beginningless time and therefore need to learn to repent. There are many more forms of repentance besides becoming a vegetarian. You should also consider bowing to the Buddhas, meditate, or bow repentances etc.I often advise my students to bow the Ten Thousand Buddhas Repentance because it is very effective. Or you could also bow the Great Compassion Repentance every day.While being vegetarian is a good form of repentance, it tends to create pressure on family and friends because we are perceived as silently criticizing them. Therefore, those who first become vegetarian frequently encounter criticism and derision. It is a test of your sincerity. You learn to quietly endure criticism and opposition and then eventually, they will accept it. In the long haul, they eventually tend to admire your resolve.Over all, to expect to repay off all your karmic debts is not feasible. Karmic retributions manifest so that we have the chance to repay our debts. To expect to be free of all debts is not that different from skipping town on your creditors: Buddhism does not advocate doing that.​Furthermore, you can use the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma as practiced in the Chinese tradition which is not available in Vietnamese temples. This is useful in cases where you wish to repay your debts quickly or those debts that are beyond your capacity to repay such as mental illnesses, possessions, etc. If you are interested, you can contact the temple directly to inquire."},{"title":"Angry Third Dhyana","content":"Question:First of all, I wish you good health and peace.I read your answer to the question of “Obstruction From Spouse”, about a wife and mother who wants to leave the home life, but is obstructed by her husband and the two daughters. I have the following questions:1. The father and the two daughters reached Third Dhyana. Is this the result of their cultivation from a previous life? Are they aware of their level?2. At Third Dhyana, why are they still angry, worse than people at zero Dhyana?​TNQ      Answer:1. To attain any level of Dhyana, one needs blessings. In other words, blessings will also create conditions to attain Dhyana levels without cultivation.For example, I have a 5-year old disciple who is already at first Dhyana because his mother has transferred blessings to him. Recently, his grandfather made him eat seafood although he is allergic to it. After eating some lobster, his face was so swollen he could not breathe, and he was rushed to Emergency. After his hospitalization, he visited me with his mother. I commended him for his courage, and gave him an apple. He almost died but he was not scared. Because of his bravery at facing a life-threatening event and for visiting the temple after his hospital stay, he reached 2nd Dhyana right away. Under the right conditions, danger can increase one’s Dhyana level.Tam Thien is Third Dhyana indeed.Most of the Chan teachers cannot perceive their student’s level. Therefore, how can the student know their own level?2. Third Dhyana is much higher than first Dhyana. When you are not in Samadhi, you are just a regular person with the usual greed and anger. But with a higher level, one can be angrier than a person at a lower level.​That’s why in our Chan training, we also teach virtue concurrently with cultivation: to learn how not to abuse your power, but to use it in a constructive way."},{"title":"Stubborn Son","content":"Question:Dear Master,Thanks for answering my previous questions. After reading your response, I have more questions to ask:​1. What did the mother of the 5 year old child do to give blessings to him? How did she help him reach 2nd Dhyana?      2. I also have a 5 year old son who is my only child. Before giving birth, I tried to cultivate to generate blessings to help him in his life. My daily cultivation practice included: reciting the Great Compassion Mantra 5-7 times and listening to the sutra lectures. I also bowed to the Buddha and meditated. However, due to time constraints, I sometimes had to limit my activities to my preferred methods of cultivation (reciting the mantra and listening to the sutra lectures). My son is quite clever with a loving compassion toward people, but he has a big temper and can be very stubborn. Besides teaching him to become a better person, what dharma doors should I cultivate to help him lessen his temper and stubbornness?Thanks for your help.​TNQ  ​Answer:1. The mother in the example I shared with you has a great affinity with the Medicine Master Buddha dharma. The following is the summary of her amazing experiences that I want to share with you:I first started teaching Chan and the Buddha name recitation from the living room of the house where I stayed. We met every Saturday to prevent competition with the Sunday activities of other temples. There were about 10 people joining the assembly each week. Together, we recited the Buddha’s name starting at 8:00 AM, had lunch, and then I lectured on the Medicine Master Sutra in the afternoon until 3:00 PM. Everything was done without any charge.The mother often visited larger, more established temples. But upon hearing about the Medicine Master Sutra lectures at our place, she was willing to take the 2 hour drive to join our small assembly.After a month, she asked me about her son’s allergy problem which was so severe that he went to Emergency about once a week. She asked if the Medicine Master Buddha dharma could help him. I said yes because I learned this dharma from a Chinese master and practiced this dharma instead of following the Vietnamese custom of praying for peace. She said that she must discuss the fee with her family. She then disappeared for a month. She probably thought that we were shysters and that we were trying to trick her for money.However, she came back the following month to ask whether the Medicine Master Buddha dharma can help heal her aunt who was very ill. I again said yes. She immediately opened her check book to request the Medicine Master Buddha plaque for her aunt.I admired her filial piety and told her that although she and her husband became a little poorer today in exchange for improving her aunt’s health, they will definitely be wealthier, mentally and spiritually.A few weeks after her aunt recovered, she requested a Medicine Master Buddha plaque for the entire family.A month later, she reported to me that her son didn’t have to go to the emergency room that often anymore.A year later, her husband and family (including her great aunt and her mother) came to cultivate with us. These family members previously opposed her decision to join our group. The entire family took the Three Refuges with the Triple Jewels and 5 Precept Ceremony at our temple.There are many more interesting responses but please allow me to stop here.2. Due to your effort of reciting the Great Compassion Mantra and your cultivation, your son has the blessings of being clever and he possesses a loving compassion. Talented people tend to have a big temper and many times are stubborn.Please allow me to make the following suggestions:In order to help him, you must continue to cultivate vigorously.Children like to imitate. They are like a sponge that can absorb everything. If you want him to be good, you must be good first. You must show by your actions that you live virtuously instead of just talking about it.You must be careful with your actions because you can influence him for years to come. If you don’t teach him now, nobody will be able to teach him in the future.Using my 5 year old disciple as an example, after one year of cultivating with us, I was able influence his parents to get rid of their arrogant behavior. As a result, the boy naturally became more respectful and started to follow instructions.As you would expect, children become good when we put them in a good environment.There are two valuable points for you to remember:​Children will only listen to those who have a Samadhi power greater than their own. To teach others, you must first increase your own Samadhi ability. If not, you must send them to a teacher who has this capacity.You should not give children money. Giving blessings is a better option. Money can lure them into trouble while blessings can help them become better people."},{"title":"Hinayana vs. Mahayana","content":"​Question:Hi Dharma Master Yong Hua:I have a question concerning Mahayana Sutra.​Please correct me if i am wrong. I have heard that even the Theravada Sages (Arhats) do not understand the Mahayana doctrines. Is it correct? If it is correct then how can a normal person like us which cannot fathom the states of the Arhats even understand the Mahayana doctrine? How come the Theravada tradition never mentioned any Mahayana Sutra if all the sutras were recounted by Ananda?       In my opinion the Theravada tradition was developed to serve its purpose which is to cross over sentient beings who have affinity with the small vehicle doctrines. The Theravada tradition has produced countless of sages which validate its existence. The Mahayana tradition also produced countless of sages which also validate its existence.Is it a matter of affinity? Whoever has affinity with either Vehicles will be attracted to each? Is it because i have affinity which means that i have planted the causes and condition in the past lives that attracted me to the Pure Land method instead of the Theravada tradition?Thank you​QN  Answer:The Hinayana Sages like the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas do not understand Mahayana Sutras because they never planted the seeds to do so.This is what competent Mahayana teachers do for their students. They help their students plant the seeds for them to certify to the Mahayana principles down the road. As you learn more about Buddhism, it’s called Literary Wisdom.The Buddha taught Buddhist principles that are appropriate to the potential of the listeners. This is what makes him a Buddha. He knows exactly what you should be taught so as to help you progress on your path to liberation. As an analogy, you do not want to teach calculus to children, do you?Ven. Ananda is in charge of collecting the Hinayana doctrines so as to teach those with Hinayana potential.We teach Mahayana principles to all living beings because we want them to plant superior seeds of Buddhahood. We want the best for all of you. In fact, once you have planted Mahayana seeds, you tend not to be satisfied with anything less, when your spiritual needs arise.By the way, we are not at all concerned with validating Mahayana or prove anything. Our objective is to help our believers end suffering and attain bliss. The better students will become Mahayana sages.As to affinity, it varies from lifetime to lifetime. The more Mahayana blessings you have, the stronger you are attracted to the Mahayana teachings.​In particular, for living beings of this Dharma Ending Age, the Pure Land Dharma is by far the best suited method of practice because it can accommodate people from lowly inferior roots to vastly superior roots. It takes a lot of blessings to believe in Pure Land Buddhism. Now that you have encountered our Pure Land approach, I hope that you will continue to tune in and learn more in order to obtain rebirth to be with Amitabha at the end of this lifetime. There is nothing more worthwhile for you and loved ones than investing to be reborn to the Western Bliss Pure Land. Then your encountering our Pure Land Mahayana Dharma would have not been in vain."},{"title":"Buddha Seeds","content":"Question:Hi Dharma Master Yong Hua,I have heard story where if one recite the Buddha’s name just once, one can achieve the Buddhahood in the distant future. This story was told by Master Hsuan Hua. This is also mentioned in the Lotus Flower Sutra. Is it the case if the more you recite the Buddha’s name the faster you achieve enlightenment?Thank you​QN, MD      Answer:That is correct.Think of it as you will, as planting the seeds for accomplishing Buddhahood.Each time we recite the Buddha’s name, we generate a Buddha seed in our Store Consciousness which is more commonly known as the 8th Consciousness. When conditions mature, then the seeds are activated and will sprout.Clearly, the more of these seeds, the more chances we have to get there.By the way, reciting the Buddha’s name is just one of the multitudes of types of seeds for Buddhahood. It’s worth noting that reciting the Buddha’s name is one of the better types of seeds for living beings in this Dharma Ending Age. Please refer to our Pure Land publications for reference. There should be two new Pure Land publications available within a few months.You might logically ask next: “What are the conditions that will make it suitable for the seeds to be activated?”​These conditions are known in Buddhism as “blessings”. They are not just any kind of blessings. The better kinds of blessings are those that are planted with Mahayana."},{"title":"Mentor","content":"Question:Dear Master,​Thank you so much for the 3 days retreat in Hawaii. It was a really great surprise to me, because the retreat was very powerful, and I feel I made some progress by the end of this retreat, which is very encouraging after a long period of regress in my meditation practice.      I particularly appreciate your straightforward advices, which gave me a clear direction in my future practice. On the other hand, the more I listen to your Dharma talks, the more I feel I need your guidance.While I am still looking for good knowing adviser in Hawaii, which seems impossible at this moment because I have visited all temples and meditation places on this island, may I sincerely ask for your guidance via Q&A until the time is coming?I started to practice meditation about 2 years ago. I felt some noticeable changes in my body and mind, which leaded me to have full faith on Buddhism. So I began to read all types of Buddhism related books which are available in Chinese, the main Sutras I recite frequently or read for a few times are: Store Earth Sutra, Diamond Sutra, Shurangama Sutra, and Lotus Sutra. I recite Amitabha for 10 breaths from the beginning of this year, and just became a vegetarian a few months ago.Regarding Pure Land Dharma door that you recommended me to practice, I have tried to recite Sutras, Mantras, and bow to the Buddha 108 etc., however, I am not very interested in Sunday’s ritual which is held in many temples. One reason is that the ritual is quite complicated which makes my mind running wildly, it’s also time consuming. Therefore, do you think if I can practice Pure Land mainly at home first? Also, should I focus on reciting Amitabha Sutra from now on?​Emituofo!YQZ, Hawaii  Answer:The sincerity of the Hawaii practitioners made our trip quite rewarding.We enjoyed cultivating with all of you.

I possess male personality traits. I often fall in love with females. All of my intimate relationships have failed miserably and painfully. We are rejected by society. Families provide no support. We hesitantly live our daily lives.      Currently, I have a girlfriend who loves me dearly but she still can’t go against the wishes of her family. She is filial to her parents.

There are plenty of similar cases out there.What offenses stop a person from having a body and mind whereby a male body functions like a male and vice versa? Why is there sometimes a male body with a female mind and vice versa?​QNHP  Answer:I am sorry for your pain and suffering.I wish people could learn to live and let live.It’s not just that your family and friends have a problem with your personal choice; I would not be surprised that they too are suffering a lot because they feel that they are “losing face”.From the Buddhist perspective, it’s all due to cause and effect. You and your loved used to create afflictions for each other and now continue to do so this lifetime.Therefore, you should learn to take advantage of the various wonderful Buddhist Dharmas to repent of your past karmic offenses. Continue to recite the Buddha’s name, bow repentance, go to the temple to ask for help to repent. This will alleviate suffering.Furthermore, the cause for your unusual choice for partners can be traced back to having excessive sexual desires in prior lives. I personally have nothing against your individual preferences but feel obligated to point out to you that indulging in it will plant causes for further suffering this lifetime as well as future lifetimes.Ordinary people are so short sighted. They can only see this lifetime. They fail to see the connection of their actions and behavior to their past lives and how the influence they could have on future lives.If you are sincere about seeking ways to end the vicious cycle, then you should seek out a good knowing adviser who can help provide guidance to get you out of pain and suffering.​Best wishes."},{"title":"Philosophy and Truth","content":"Question:Master, can you please comment on this quotation?The student asked the master “what is the difference between a genius and a madman?”The master replied “The genius uses his madness constructively, while the madman uses his genius destructively.”​It’s not about how much you have; it’s what you do with it.      Answer:​The madman does not realize the damage he is inflicting on others. Our brand of Buddhism emphasizes cultivation to eliminate confusion so as not to harm others, not for the sake of knowledge alone.​That really translates into relentlessly trying to continue to progress instead of being satisfied with the status quo.

This being would appear so that she or her family members could see it but would not reveal its face. On such occasions, she felt no fear because the yin being did not cause any trouble, but rather, it would often wake her up to remind her to cultivate without tardiness. She then would recite the Buddha’s name. When she recited the Buddha’s name, the yin being would leave.She asked me to ask you: at the time of death, if that being manifests and retains her what can she do?For now, what can she do to prevent that from happening in the future?Emituofo,​Nh. Nh. California  ﻿Answer:The yin being seems to have no ill intentions. However, that could change down the road, especially at the time of death.It can be dealt with from two sides.First, she should bring forth the mind of kindness and compassion to help liberate the yin being, to help it detach from her. If not, it might persist into future lives. She should recite the Buddha’s name and dedicate the resulting merit and virtue to help the yin being attain liberation. If she feels that her gongfu is inadequate in helping others obtain liberation, she could request a rebirth plaque for the yin being. That is one of the ways to use the Dharma to turn attachment into liberation.​From her side, she is right in understanding that from this experience, at the time of death, obstructions can arise to prevent her rebirth. If she can, she should get a rebirth plaque for herself to pave the way (to resolve obstructions) and accrue rebirth blessings."},{"title":"Obstruction from Spouse","content":"​Question:Master,​We are in a bind, please help us. Our entire family is Buddhist and try to cultivate every day so as to improve ourselves. However, my father forbids my mother to cultivate too much because he feels that Buddhism is too abstract. He does not really understand. Perhaps he does not want to understand. He took refuge with the Triple Jewel, goes to the temple but he refuses to cultivate.       Each time that my mother returns from the temple, he would pick a fight with her although she fulfills her responsibilities of a wife and mother, thus poisoning the atmosphere in the household. Each week, my mother can only go to the temple once or twice, and recites the Buddha’s name at home. Each time that she goes to the temple, she is afraid that he will yell at her and could destroy his own blessings. She has had a very hard life. Now she only wants to cultivate to end suffering but my father still is against her cultivation even after a lifetime of devotion to the family.My father is not willing to listen and does not believe in Buddhism. Therefore he does not want my mother to worship the Triple Jewel too much. My father is a good man and is virtuous but he forbids my mother to cultivate. Although we all tried to explain to him and brought up many examples or facts, he still refuses to believe nor does he want to understand. Now, my siblings and I do not know what to do to change our father’s mind because our mother is very unhappy. We all recite the Buddha’s name, recite sutras and transfer the merit and virtue to our father. Unfortunately, perhaps his obstructions are so heavy, it does not seem to have any effect. Please tell us what to do to change our father’s attitude about cultivation. Thank you for your guidance.​TN, California  Answer:That is suffering! I heard so many similar stories.This is truly a case of old enmities and past creditors. Your mother has been paying her entire life and it’s still not enough. If she obtains liberation, how can he make a claim on her?Please stop ganging up on him and try to explain to him.One way to resolve the problem is to continue to patiently endure it. She should also seek a good knowing adviser to learn from. Why? Because she can continue to cultivate at the same pace but can make more progress. Why does she need to progress? To prove to your father that cultivation makes her a better person for real (in other words, so far your father is unimpressed with Buddhism because your mother’s Buddhist cultivation is useless to him).At the same time, you should create a lot more blessings for your father in order to help your mother pay him back, just like you have been doing.So what is the difference? The difference is that with the guidance of a good knowing advisor, the blessings will multiply. The more blessings he receives, the quicker the debt is repaid and the sooner she is freed.It’s not uncommon for your loved ones to create severe obstructions to your cultivation. Let me tell you a story which has been more difficult to resolve than your mother’s case.One of our disciples used to go to another well known temple to plant her blessings on the weekend and she did this continuously for ten years. She then came to us by referral because she needed help with one of her illnesses. We taught her meditation and that sickness went away in two months. She brought forth the resolve to leave the home life. Her husband and two twenty-something daughters objected violently. They counter proposed that she was free to do as she pleased but she should cultivate at home. However, she truly wanted to practice the left home people’s Dharma in order to more quickly escape suffering and attain bliss. Her husband said no in no uncertain terms. That if she left the home life to be with us, he will follow her to the temple and “destroy” us.She was desperate and felt like giving up. She came to see me and asked for advice. I advised her to pay her debts more quickly. She requested three Medicine Master Buddha plaques for her husband and two daughters. Furthermore, she patiently continued to go to the temple once a week on the weekend to cultivate. Her family decided to follow her to the temple to take a look at me to see what kind of cult we had here. That’s when I realized that the husband and youngest daughter were at Third Dhyana even though they did not cultivate, whereas she was at zero Dhyana. After six months of hard work, she attained Fourth Dhyana and changed a lot: she became more patient, softer in demeanor, healthier, happier (less temperamental), more virtuous, wiser, etc. A year later, her husband agreed to allow her to leave the home life. The youngest daughter is no longer as violently opposed to it as before."},{"title":"Oregon Assembly","content":"Question:Dear Master,I have been planning to go to the one week retreat in Oregon with Master Heng Sure starting end of the month, and also combine that with a week or two at CTTB.

I used to go to the temple but rarely bowed to the Buddhas. I would look inside and half bowed to the images.​Two years ago, my mother was upset with work and committed suicide. The master who came to recite for her encouraged me to recite suttras. At first I recited the Earth Store Sutra. Then I recited the Lotus Sutra.      I was also advised to transfer the merit and virtue to help my mother obtain liberation. Since then I was able to learn a little bit more about the principles. However, whenever I recited the sutras, my mind was chaotic and I had a hard time concentrating on the recitation. I’d like to ask you to teach me how to be able to concentrate on reciting sutras or mantras so that I can have clarity and purity of mind and thus enable me to obtain grater benefits as well as understand more about Buddhism.I am grateful for your guidance.I wish you good health.Emituofo.​LDN  Answer:I sincerely hope that your mother received help to obtain liberation. Her manner of death is not good. She most likely fell to the lower realms!You have blessings to receive guidance on your practice. Unfortunately, you still do not understand how to practice.Do you know why you are able to recite sutras? It’s from creating merit and virtues: you helped print sutras, make offerings to the Triple Jewel etc… The critical first step in cultivation is to plant blessings.Please continue to make even more offerings to Mahayana and eventually your mind will increasingly at peace.I like to advise my students to bow to the Buddhas. I am enclosing a dharma talk on bowing with the reply email for your reference. Bowing is one of the most important dharmas for beginners because it creates inconceivable blessings.After you create blessings, make sure to ask the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to help find a good knowing adviser in order to learn Mahayana.​When you have adequate blessings, then you will enjoy Mahayana books such as those of Great Master Xuan Hua or his disciples. When you have even greater blessings, then you will find a wise teacher."},{"title":"Advance and Retreat","content":"Question:Master,First, allow me to bow in respect. I was exposed to the Pure Land Dharma Door about 6-7 years ago. However, I am sad to admit that I am not a truly practicing Buddhist. It makes me feel ashamed and unsettling. Sometimes, I vigorously recite the Buddha’s name but it won’t belong before I stop because it got me nowhere. I sincerely wish to be able to find a bright eye good knowing adviser who can teach me how to cultivate so that I can eliminate false-thinking and reduce my afflictions. I hope that you will guide me in my daily practice so that I can regain the purity of my mind. By the way, I connected with you through Facebook. I live about 30 min from your temple.I look forward to your reply. I wish you good health.Emituofo,​DN      ​Answer:Your situation is quite common place.The good thing is that you wish to cultivate. You also have the blessings to believe in the Pure Land Dharma Door.It is unfortunate that you do not know how to cultivate. That was why you made no progress in cultivation. It is not surprising that you were dejected because how can one continue if cultivation seems to have no real concrete benefits at all!If you really want to cultivate, you should:Pick a good knowing adviser: who has enough precept, samadhi and wisdom to the point that he is no longer greedy for fame or money.Pick a good assembly: if you have good co-cultivators, then you are less likely to lose heart when you encounter difficulties in your practice.Select the proper Dharma Door: this is closely related to the teacher. The good knowing adviser tends to have many dharma doors that are appropriate for people with different potential. If you have the appropriate Dharma Door then you can quickly make progress. For example, I have a student who practiced Zen for over ten years. He then came to our temple to practice Pure Land. After less than a year total time of practicing with us, he realized that his level is higher than his previous Zen teacher.Selecting a good knowing adviser is most critical to your practice.In summary, you should resolve to actively seek a good knowing adviser. Every day, you should bow to Amitabha Buddha 108 times, seeking his guidance to help you find a wise teacher. You should also invest the time to visit the various temples to get a feel of the atmosphere, the attitude of the left home people there, whether or not the assembly is serious about cultivation, then you should get the temple’s own publications to see what kind of Mahayana they are teaching.If you really follow the above-mentioned instructions, in the future the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will eventually guide you to meet with a competent and wise teacher."},{"title":"42 Hands & Eyes","content":"Question:Great Master Xuan Hua explains that the Great Compassion Mantra is like having the hands and would require the 42 Hands and Eyes Dharma which are like the legs. Could you elaborate on it please?If I wish to cultivate the Hands and Eyes Dharma door, can I follow the instructions from the books or do I need to receive transmission?Thank you,​NQ      Answer:The Great Compassion Mantra and 42 Hands and Eyes are specialized Dharmas for Great Master Xuan Hua’s llineage. They bear the very heavy burden of propagating Mahayana and therefore need these types of specialized Dharmas to facilitate their work.The Hands and Eyes are a Secret School Dharma and must be transmitted before it can be cultivated. Nowadays, only a few of Great Master Xuan Hua’s most senior disciples are authorized to transmit this Dharma. You can find publications and other materials on the Internet about this Dharma. However, you should not cultivate it. Why not?The publicly available materials have many inaccuracies.There is no description on how to cultivate this Dharma. This is not unlike getting a hold of a description of the various karate chops but no directions on how to practice them.Most importantly, this secret Dharma must be transmitted by an authorized teacher before it can be practiced. To practice without such transmission is to commit Dharma theft. One will not be able to accomplish it, have many obstructions and difficulties in its practice and will fall to the hells for stealing the Dharma.Allow me to emphasize again: do not practice this Dharma unless you have received transmission from a senior sanghan from the DRBA’s big wigs. As far as I know, they rarely transmit this anymore. There is no need to be greedy. If you have the potential, you will eventually be able to receive transmission."},{"title":"Chan patriarchs teach Pure Land","content":"Question:Dear master, I read the following sentences from Pure Land narratives but don’t understand what it means. I know Vietnamese but just don’t understand the concept why Zen masters all switched over to Pure Land.Could you please expound on these?​“Of the 13 patriarchs of the Pure Land School, there are seven who are accomplished Chan Masters.      ​They are:Cheng Yuan 承遠, Yong Ming 永明, Lian Chi 蓮池, Ou Yi 藕益, Xing Ce 行策, Sheng An省庵 and Che Wu 徹悟.Why did they get enlightened through the Chan Dharma Door but chose not to teach Chan but instead decided to propagate Pure Land? Three reasons were given:1. Dharma Door aspect: Chan is most appropriate for those with superior superior roots, those with middle and inferior roots have no chance to penetrate this Dharma Door (“Phi thượng thượng căn, thận vật khinh hứa” – Tổ ngữ). In contrast, Pure Land can be appropriate for all three types of roots. Those with superior roots who cultivate Pure Land can see their nature, attain the Buddha recitation samadhi, and will be reborn onto the superior grade at the end of their life. Even for those with extremely inferior roots, if they can recite the Buddha’s name, they too can carry their karma along with their rebirth, and attain irreversibility. Upon rebirth, they can draw near Amitabha Buddha, have sagely companions, live for limitless kalpas. Therefore there is no need to worry about not seeing one’s self nature and certify to the sagely positions! Because of they will for sure obtain these tremendous benefits that the patriarchs promoted the Pure Land School.2. Time aspect: During the Proper Dharma Age, the overwhelming majority of those who practiced certified to the fruitions. Those who did not planted the Chan seeds for future practices. During the Dharma Semblance Age, few people can awaken to the Way. During the Dharma Ending Age, as is said in the Great Accumulation Sutra: “One hundred million of hundred million people practice, it’s rare that one person awaken to the Way”. One may awaken to the Way, but one does not necessarily certify to the positions, one’s afflictions are still prevalent, while revolving in the wheel one is confused by the retributions, therefore nine out of ten will regress. As a result, from the end of the Dharma Semblance Age to the Dharma Ending Age, the good knowing advisers gradually change directions and started teaching Pure Land. At those times the Chan School was still popular, the patriarchs therefore devised expedients: first they obtained awakening through Chan, and then started propagating Pure Land, in order to persuade the people at those times.3. Potential and conditions aspect: From the onset of the Dharma Ending Age, the majority of the people are of middle to inferior roots. In order to benefit living beings in their lifetime, the Bodhisattvas need to accord with their potential by advocating Pure Land. The other Schools also need to be cultivated, however it is no longer of primordial importance, because they fail to provide universal and great benefits to living beings.The wise and honored ones from the other Schools understand this too well. They therefore still propagate their own doctrine while leaning toward Pure Land. Just like a Chan Master said: “Those who practice the Cao Dong Chan School are secretly practicing Pure Land, because Pure Land makes it easier to see the Buddha than Chan” (Ðộng hạ nhất tông giai cụ mật tu, dĩ Tịnh Ðộ kiến Phật vưu giản vị ư Tông môn).Another Dharma Master advocated the Tian Tai School and recited the Buddha’s name. At the end of his life, he recited a verse of encouragement to the Great Assembly:​Because of reciting the Buddha’s name,I get to see the Pure Land.This is a true response!The Great Assembly should recite ever more vigorously!  Answer:I am not qualified to adequately comment on the teachings of the patriarchs and venerated sanghans. However, since you asked, I’ll try to present my limited views and shallow understanding.Concerning the three reasons why Chan patriarchs decided to propagate Pure Land instead of Chan, I do not necessarily agree with all the reasons listed. First because some was lost in the translation from Chinese into Vietnamese. Another reason is the teachings were for another time and culture and therefore the language used is not that clear to the modern day cultivators. I’ll try to present my view in a more direct and concise manner:1. Dharma Door: I agree that Pure Land is more suitable to a wider range of potentials than Chan which is most appropriate for those with superior roots only. I also agree with the rest as well. It is the reasons that are often provided too. Personally, I’d like to add that the real reason that the above-mentioned patriarchs teach Pure Land instead of Chan is out of their great compassion. Clearly, teaching Pure Land means that they have to teach more pupils. It is a lot more trouble than those of us who do not have to teach can ever imagine.2. Times: I differ from your quote here. In this Dharma Ending Age, living beings no longer are able to cultivate in a sustained fashion. Chan requires long periods of vigorous cultivation and few are able to do it any more. For example, our Chan Qi typically goes from 3 am until midnight for seven days. Few people are able to keep up with it. The majority is simply scared and would not dare go anywhere near it. In contrast, reciting the Buddha’s name is not as demanding and therefore more suitable to the masses.3. Potential and conditions: Granted that we are not as blessed in this day and age. I am not so sure about the claim that Chan practitioners secretly practice Pure Land. I’ll submit to you that it is very unlikely to obtain liberation this lifetime for the majority of us. Therefore the patriarchs urge us to seek rebirth as soon as possible so as to get out of the sea of birth and death. Another very important reason why they advocate rebirth to the Pure Land is because we can then attain irreversibility. As long as as we still revolve in the wheel, we often regress in our cultivation.​I wholeheartedly agree with the patriarchs. In fact, those who are truly blessed will understand the importance of maximizing their chances of obtaining rebirth this very lifetime."},{"title":"Deviant sex precept infraction","content":"Question:Dear Master,I have been a Buddhist for quite a few years and I enjoy learning Buddhism a lot!

I have a girlfriend who is also a Buddhist and a vegetarian, but because of today’s society we can’t maintain a pure live.

This is not an easy thing to do for modern people.The Five Precepts forbids sex outside of marriage. This does not apply to the general believers who have not received the Five Precepts.Unfortunately, your case is quite common because most temples do not provide the proper training about the Five Precepts before transmitting them. We train our disciples to make sure that they thoroughly understand the Five Precepts Dharma before transmitting it. In that way, they can avoid problems like yours.​You need to perform a special repentance Dharma with people who can be of real assistance. In Northern California, you may contact Ven.

In the Buddhist tradition do we also pray to help those we care for? Will we have to pay for it later with bearing some affliction?       Also, I noticed that when I requested 2 Medicine Master plaques recently, I became a little sick with cold sores in my mouth (which I still have), headaches, and so forth. Is that a result because of my requests?​VS, Long Beach, CA  ​Answer:Yes the Buddhists also pray for others. We do it slightly differently. We believe in giving away all the goodness we generate from our cultivation to benefit all living beings. This is the cornerstone of our Buddhist practice because it reflects the Mahayana spirit of helping all living beings. At times, we also dedicate the merit and virtue of our practice to specific individuals to help them overcome temporary setbacks like illnesses and misfortunes etc… When doing so, we are able to provide help to the extent of our ability but will also incur some consequences for meddling into other people’s affairs.As to the Medicine Master Buddha Dharma that is available through the temple, it allows people to meddle without incurring any direct consequences.You minor illnesses are coincidental and are not related to those plaques. You can be rest assured that it is the case for of that Dharma.Funny that I have been reviewing the Earth Sore Sutra explanation and happened upon a passage that pertains to your situation when I took a break. I came back and found your email. What a coincidence! I’ll include it for your early reference:The Buddha says the four things that cannot be obtained sutra 佛說四不可得經: the world has four things that cannot be obtained:To have a youthful appearance 年幼, 顏色煒燁, to be loved and respected by the multitudes 眾人愛敬. One suddenly ages, the hair becomes white and the teeth fall. Those who wish for the fountain of youth 欲使常少不老, ultimately cannot obtain it 終不可得.One’s body is healthy and strong 身體強健. Illnesses suddenly befall those who are healthy 為謂毫強疾病卒至˙眾患難癒. Those wishing for permanent peace and no illnesses 欲免常安無病, will not obtain it 終不可得.Desiring for long life 欲求長壽. The five desires are still raging like the wind blowing at the clouds 五欲永存˙非常對至˙如風吹雲. Those wishing for long life 冀念長生 will not get what they want 終不可得.To have the parents and siblings’ love, honor and happiness 父母兄弟˙恩愛榮樂. When one’s past karmas suddenly arrive 宿對卒至. It’s like hot water melts the snow 如湯消雪. Those who wish for immortality 欲求不死 will not obtain it.Since the ancient times, throughout the creation of the heavens and earth, there is no way to avoid these four misfortunes. Because of these four difficulties, Buddhas appear in world. If one wishes to escape these four sufferings, there is nothing better than reciting the Buddha’s name."},{"title":"Great Compassion Mantra fighting","content":"Question:(The original question was in Vietnamese. It was translated as follows: )​1. Before reciting the Buddha’s name, I used to recite the Great Compassion mantra every day. Occasionally, when I would not be able to recite the Mantra for a few days in a row because I could not find the time to recite, I would dream that I was reciting it. About eight months ago, I started switching to reciting the Buddha’s name and stopped reciting the Great Compassion Mantra. Recently, I started dreaming that I was reciting the Mantra again. Does it mean that I have good affinity with the Mantra? If so, what should I do? If I recite both the Mantra and the Buddha’s name, would it make it difficult to be single-minded?      2. When I recited the Great Compassion Mantra, my intention was to eradicate karmic obstructions and in particular, increase the mind of compassion and not to defeat the deviant and demons. But I dreamt of using the Mantra to fight with those who wished to harm me. Why is there such discrepancy between my normal state of mind and my state of mind in my dreams?Thank you for your guidance.​TNQ  Answer:1. It’s rather difficult to answer the questions because we need more details. You are much better off seeking out the instructions of a good knowing adviser in person in order to get a better resolution.However, I’ll try to give general answers to help shed some light.There several ways to practice the Great Compassion Mantra. One could recite it five times, twenty-one times or 108 times etc… depending on one’s potential and conditions. You practiced the Mantra for a while and have obtained a small response. If I were you, I would not stop maintaining the Mantra but would invest more time in reciting the Buddha’s name as well.Having affinity with a particular Dharma will make it easier to become single-minded. Furthermore, once you know how to be single-minded, you can practice any Dharma.On the other hand, specializing in a single Dharma may not necessarily result in becoming single-minded no matter how long you will practice it.Finally, if you have the guidance of a good knowing adviser, it would be easier for you to become single-minded regardless of which Dharma door you practice.2. Although we specialize in practicing Chan and Pure Land in parallel, a small number of our students were transmitted the Great Compassion Mantra Dharma door. Unlike the majority of the people who practice the tantric dharmas because they hope to obtain spiritual penetrations, we practice the Great Compassion Tantra in order to eradicate our offenses and develop our mind of Great Compassion.I myself have been practicing the Great Compassion Mantra for quite a while but have never dreamt of using it to fight the demons that came to harass me in my dreams. Furthermore, when I discovered that some of my pupils used mantras to fight the ghosts and demons, I gave them a good scolding and asked them to stop. We practice in order to unfold our wisdom and not to impose our will on our enemies.​If you still have fighting dreams, you should repent of your mind of fighting and desire to prevail over others. That shows that your practice lacks the proper foundation and would make it difficult to become single-minded."},{"title":"Phony","content":"Question:Master:​[My friend] invited me to her house for her dinner several times.

The problem is that employer is our company’s competition which is located 10-minute away.      ​In order to help her secure that job, I have to say good stuffs which is the same as lying. She doesn’t have enough experience to handle many situations which she thought she knows. My supervisor and I now have to clean up her mess.I asked for the supervisor for opinion.

The worse thing is just saying yes to everything including all her demands and messes.I asked the boss for permission he said that he trusted my decision but he thinks that I should not get involve because whatever I say will affect the company’s image and will come back to bite me.

You could say that you liked her as a person (think about the things that you like about her). It is your professional responsibility to be truthful about her qualifications but you do not necessarily have to provide all the details. For example, as an employer who calls upon you to ask about someone’s qualifications, I won’t blame you for if you did inform me that she’s inexperienced and would need some training.As a rule of thumb, do not lie until you have real wisdom (it’ll take a while yet).To be truthful is to be nice in the long run to all concerned. You can’t be nice to your friend but be not nice to yourself and colleagues.I would come up with a real lame excuse for backing out of the dinner invitation to make sure that she gets it: that you are not fooled by the phoniness.

At the time of death: the hot spot at the forehead results a rebirth into the heavens; the hot spot at the chest results a rebirth in human realm; the hot spots at the feet result a falling to hells or animal realm. Is that right, Master? What materials, sutras would mention about this matter?      2.

Do people need to take precepts before leaving their home lives? Can people receive Bhikshu precepts before becoming Bhikshus?Sincerely yours,​NPP   ​Answer:1. There is a Chinese verse that says that when the last warm part of the body is the:a. Top of the head: Birth to the Buddhas’ Pure Lands,b. Eye/forehead: Birth onto the Heavens,c.

Sitting in full lotus position is more difficult, therefore is a lot more effective. Caution: do not to meditate alone because it’s easy to get into trouble. It’s better to have a teacher to guide you. People who are blessed are able to find a teacher who knows where they are and guide them to higher samadhi levels.3.

Simultaneously, your body takes a beating from your temper and aggression.More specifically, when you get angry, your heart and liver take a beating. Not surprisingly, nowadays it’s not uncommon for people to have heart and liver problems as they get older since they get angry quite often.Learn to cool off as soon as you feel the heat or anger or aggression arise internally. Instead, bring forth the mind of kindness and compassion: not many people can withstand your anger or aggression. Learn to see through it and put it down. Learn not to contend. Your husband is better than you in this area. He seems to be a lot more at peace than you.Adopt a more yielding and harmonious attitude.

PT, allow me to be direct with you.If it does offend you, please accept my sincere apologies. I have been spoiled by my followers who graciously allowed me to speak my mind without having to beat around the bush.As I see it:1. I understand that you are committed to the orphans at your temple. That is most remarkable. However, do not forget that you are a left-home person. You severed family ties and renounced love to become a nun. How could you allow yourself to be tied up again in another family (of your orphans) at your temple?2. Ven. PT made progress very rapidly because she has the proper Dharma door, right environment and appropriate guidance. In contrast, you have none of those and are further encumbered by the temple work that can be just overwhelming. No wonder you can’t progress in your cultivation. I would say that you are more committed to cultivating blessings than cultivating samadhi and wisdom. You get what you sowed.3. If you do wish to work on your gongfu (samadhi and wisdom) then you should unburden yourself with the temple responsibilities. I am sure that they will do just fine without you. No one is that indispensable, really.4. You are getting older. Time is running short. It won’t be long before you have not much strength and energy to cultivate. You’ve generated a lot of blessings so far. Isn’t time for you to shift gear and try to use those blessings to cultivate wisdom? May I suggest that since you are so often afflicted by your daily responsibilities, it is very hard for you to ascend to higher realms at your death time?5. If you do decide to change emphasis, then you need to go to the mountain because “the mountain does not go to Mohammed”.​6. Pick a jeweled mountain and go there to amass true jewels. That would seem to be more appropriate for a person of your caliber and aspirations. End birth and death before you have the wisdom and strength to help a lot more people (i.e. right now, you have inadequate samadhi power and wisdom to effectively help others).

Anyway, I will do what I can.Regards,​TB, Van Nuys, California      Answer:​To recite is to obtain responses.If you really believe so, stop looking for signs of a response. If it’s the right thing to do, then do it without any expectations, that is true kindness.​I commend your making an effort to lend a helping hand to someone in his hour of need. I assure you that he greatly appreciates it. In my humble opinion, that’s what brings meanings to life."},{"title":"Premonition Dream","content":"Question:​Hello Master,I am [JT]’s friend [PL]. I came and stayed there one night at the temple, and was thankful for the advice given. I am doing better, and may have a new job in Cardiology. I have a question for you. I was sleeping the other night and thought I heard someone knocking very loud at the door, it woke me up. No one was there, but it startled me, and I felt an uncomfortable feeling. I get a lot of signs before things happen. Can you explain this to me? Thank You for your time.​PL, San Diego, California       Answer:​It’s not uncommon to get what is called premonition dreams: of things to come. On the other hand, more often, it’s just regular dreaming that is of not much consequence.There’s also another class of dream that is associated with harassment from beings from the yin world. This comes from causes planted from the past. For example, you used to harass your neighbor in a past life. Now he’s become a ghost and wants to get back at you.Left home people like me do not usually indulge in dream interpretations even if we happen to possess such knowledge. We can help when need be. For example, quite a few people dream of past relatives (e.g. deceased parents) who are in distress. Mahayana would have means to extend a lending help toward them and even rescue them from sufferings.Do good and you have nothing to worry about.​I’m glad to hear that things are looking up for you. Please keep in mind that health care professionals are in the business of meddling into others’ business. It’s unfortunate you never had the opportunity to learn of Buddhist Dharmas to help mitigate these forces. Until then, make sure to do good and you can reasonably well weather all storms."},{"title":"Selling Alcohol","content":"​Question:​Master,​I’m sorry to bother you about this issue. However, I have conflicting feelings about choices that I am being forced to make, and I am not sure what to do. As you know, my parents arrived to visit this past weekend. Recently, I found out that they have refinanced their home to help my sister purchase a convenience store business. For the past few days they have been looking at store locations and have found a place in Orange.       The process of negotiation is nearly complete and they are about ready to sign a contract to buy the store. My parents are now requesting that I cosign for the store ownership and will not allow me to choose to back out, think it through, or discuss the situation. My sister cannot sign by herself due to financial losses caused by a recent divorce where she lost an investment in a dry cleaning store which was underwritten by my parents.I understand that my parents are under great pressure, and out of their love, they want to help their children succeed financially and live a good life. But, I question how this would help my sister in her current situation. She does not have the ability to manage a store by herself, since she rarely worked in the dry cleaning business that she previously owned with her former husband. Why am I being forced to take financial responsibility for a situation over which I have no control, and am not allowed to refuse? Is this situation a retribution for something that I have done to someone else in a previous life? Will I also be forced to break precepts since the store sells intoxicants (alcoholic beverages)?I have discussed this with my wife, and she does not want me to jump into this business venture. She still remembers the Master telling her not to sign anything when opening a store. I am not sure what course of action I should follow. If I do not agree to cosign, I feel that I am not fulfilling my filial responsibility to my parents since they have given me so much. But, complying with their wishes may entangle me in many complications that I cannot foresee. My wife has suggested that, if I really must sign, as a precaution for my own family I should do it by myself and file financial separation paperwork so that she would not be financially affected if the business fails.​JC, Lake Elsinore, California   Answer:​This proposal has quite a few flaws, especially on the business side.However, I will confine my reply to the spiritual issues, for now. You certainly should consider bringing it up for discussion with our assembly when you have a chance.Do not sign. You are not being filial to your parents if you follow a path that will cause harm to them and a lot of other living beings – including your sister and her family.Make it clear to your family that you want to be filial but will not become involved with the liquor business in any way, even if it is only stocking the shelves or operating the cash register for free.You do not want to bring that karma back to your own wife and family. Your parents and siblings can surely understand your obligations to your own family.Be blunt about it: admit to them that so far you have not fulfilled your financial obligations to your own family and you are being asked to engage in something that conflicts with your family’s beliefs.There are better ways to make a living without inflicting harm on others. In Buddhism, selling alcohol is a grave offense because it renders others stupid and creates causes for their own downfall. Also, it is not consistent with your attempt to obtain wisdom and facilitate your own liberation.You do not have to compromise on this because it is a stupid undertaking without any doubt. You are better off incurring their anger now for refusing than to have them justifiably blame you for their downfall in the future.​As far as I am concerned, there is no filial responsibility to help inflict harm on others. Remember that you sometimes have to give tough love to your own son? This is an opportunity to do the same for your own parents and siblings because they don’t know any better!"},{"title":"49 Day Ceremony For Mom’s Friend","content":"Question: Master,I have a stupid question on sincerity.​My mom’s good friend is dying of cancer. She could pass any day now. My mom asked me if there is anything she can do. I advised her about the 49 days, but she and her friends are Christian. I then suggested purchasing rebirth plaques for a couple of months, which she would like to do.      I believe that I can request the 49 day plaque for her, but I am beginning to question whether this is right.Questions such as:Is it my place to do this for them? Does this mean I should help and request for everyone I know who is dying? How can I justify the expense to my husband? Should I reserve the resource for my love ones? But should I not be picking and choosing? Should I be overly concerned about this?Does my over analysis indicate a lack of sincerity? Should I instantly feel that I want to request a 49 day rebirth plaque?Please advice.​AT, Cerritos, California   Answer: Excellent questions! You don’t have a sincerity problem.First of all, the 49-day plaque includes going to the heavens as well. It’s designed to more or less shoot for the minimum of not falling into the three evil paths. That is why we should be consulted so as to determine the proper course of action. Also, the 49-day Dharma basically allows the deceased a choice of going for a human/heaven rebirth versus to the Pure Land. So far, our clients (of all faith and non-faith backgrounds) chose to go to the Western Bliss Pure Land.Since it is your mother’s friend, she will have to decide. You did the right thing by telling her about our Buddhist 49-day Dharma. I’m very pleased that you even considered requesting it for her friend. That’s very generous of you. No wonder [another student] & you are such great friends; you’re both very kind-hearted.Typically, when we are consulted on the 49-day Dharma, we closely examine the case/conditions and make the recommendation. Should we see that the deceased is falling into the lower realms, we would recommend more appropriate courses of actions. For example, when [well known US senator] was dying, I knew that he was in bad shape and destined to fall. I gently brought it up in class but no one took it to heart. As a result, he fell into the animal realm.Coming back to you.I do not recommend that you request the 49-day ceremonies for your mother’s friend. You should explain this Dharma to your mother so as to educate her. She might be impressed with your growth unless she has already noticed it.The reason is because, as you pointed it out, you will have a hard time justifying it to your husband. We are not talking about a few hundred dollars here! He should be consulted on major purchases, not only because of monetary considerations but, equally important, because mutual consultation builds understanding and trust.​You would be better off investing in rebirth plaques for his parents. Now that you married into their family, you should treat his parents as if they are your own: visit them more regularly (i.e. bring your husband along so that he can visit them as well) and make the effort to get to know them better. Take care of your own family first before enlarging to others. Never make the mistake of neglecting your immediate family; remember to build your base."},{"title":"Too Little Too Late","content":"​Question: Master,​I checked my records and 9/20/09 sent you an e-mail regarding my niece TB requesting a 6-month Lengthening Life plaque for her. I updated you in that e-mail regarding her health problems which began shortly after I had been in Ohio during her fathers’ last days of life in 4/07. She initially thought she was reacting to her fathers’ death. She was diagnosed with biliary duct cancer with 3 spots on her lungs.       Initially treated with chemo therapy then when I requested the Lengthening Life Plaque she began radiation therapy-along with chemo. She had many set-backs and worked up until the last month or two before her death 3/11/10. We discussed her condition at the time of her initial diagnosis. You suggested that you would work with her if she would come out here for a month. Of course that never did happen. She had to work to survive/live, as she was not financially set.[…]Of course I do want the 49-day Rebirth Plaque for TB.If you have any questions let me know…​RL, Long Beach, California   Answer: My condolences for your loss.Our records indicate that a Lengthening Life was set up as per your request from 9/11/09-3/10/10.Please read the Dharma Talk titled “On healing Illnesses” on our Web site www.BLI2PL.org archives. It explains why I suggested that she came to see me so that I could directly help her.Since all other means failed, there is only the last Buddhist approach of creating blessings to induce healing. You may recall your Long Beach friend who came to me with cancer after her doctors gave up on her. She got a permanent Lengthening Life plaque AND took on personal meditation practice. As a result, her cancer stopped progressing and her own doctor took her off all medication.Miracles do happen!It was unfortunate that when TB was at the end of her rope, there was not enough faith that we can help (external help). TB herself was not even willing to try our venue to fight for her life (self-help). Miracles do not happen without faith in others and in oneself.Again, I offer to you and family my sincere condolences.​Let’s make sure not to come up short again during critical time (49-day period) so that she does get a good reincarnation. Even though she lacked faith while she was with us, I’m hoping to able to present her with the option of going to the Western Bliss Pure Land to have a most happy eternal life."},{"title":"Health Improves With Cultivation","content":"Question: Dear Dharma Master,First off, I hope you are fine and all is well.

How is that being immortal?​AT, Cerritos, California       Answer: The term immortal really is a misnomer. Although they are called immortals because they live for very long (in some cases, 10,000’s of years), they eventually die.In Buddhism, all that is conditioned is impermanent. For example, our physical body is conditioned and will, therefore, eventually decay and disintegrate.​The Taoist Dharma is wonderful, in that they cleanse their bodies quite efficaciously, thus managing to extend life. But, that is also a drawback; they are still attached to life. It is that attachment that actually obstructs ever-lasting life. Arhats (or higher level practitioners) manage to drop all attachments, thus ending involuntary birth and death – they can live as long as they wish."},{"title":"Kneeling While Reciting Sutras","content":"Question:Master,Is it acceptable to kneel during the recitation of the Amitabha Sutra in the morning ceremony?​UN, Long Beach, California       Answer:Excellent!Your faith is deepening.Sutras should be recited with utmost respect. Reciting in the kneeling position is an excellent practice.For example, when you recite it at home, you may kneel.​However, when we are practicing the Great Assembly Dharma, the congregation should collectively follow the lead of the Ceremony Master. To be the only one kneeling while others are standing would draw too much attention to yourself, and may, therefore, be inappropriate."},{"title":"Temperamental Ancestors","content":"Question: Is this true?Article: Celebration of UllambanaIf you feel you have a big temper and too much fire of ignorance, it is because your parents and other relatives from the past have not left suffering and attained bliss.

If you feel that this may be the case, you should take advantage of this opportunity to do merit and virtue to cross them over; and will cause all those in difficulty to leave worry and suffering and to eradicate obstacles from offenses.​JT, Lake Elsinore, California       Answer:I disagree with the sweeping nature of the above statement. It’s probably due to the combination of:Quotation taken out of contextInaccurate translationOverzealous left home people who are trying to teach about giving.There are a few instances where people are influenced by their ancestors.

I was wondering about any or your thoughts about that? Seems kind of strange, but again so are many things.Article: Artificial Meat​JC, San Mateo, California      Answer:Scientific progress can help us inflict less harm to the environment in the process of providing less toxic food at lower costs.However, the biggest obstacle is the flavor problem. Let’s face it: the great variety of animals gives us an enormous taste spectrum. People enjoy animal meat because of the flavor, not necessarily for nutrition sake. I don’t know how artificial meat can replicate the freshness of a kill or the flavors of say the special grains that are used to feed the livestock. In addition, throughout the ages, people hunt because the kill gives them that special rush that probably comes with the feeling of power over others’ lives.​Animal protection groups are taking a step in the right direction by staking the moral high grounds. Eventually, just like those many of you who decided to become vegetarian, they’ll realize that it’s about great compassion."},{"title":"Cutting Tree","content":"​Question:Master,My wife is planning a remodel of our house. This will involve scraping the lot to the ground to build a new house. As a result we will be removing some trees.​I am concerned about the trees and living beings that reside on our property. Is there some dharma that can help them as we remodel the house? You had mentioned in the past that one could write a note and put in a tree to inform the living beings that the tree was going to be trimmed.      I was planning on writing a note saying the tree was being removed. I feel bad about removing the tree. Is there anything I can do for it? I also plan on writing a note for the living beings in the house before we tear it down. Is there anything else I can/should be doing?​BB, Manhattan Beach, California   Answer: The tree spirits and beings who reside in your community also tend to be well-off (and therefore not good to offend). When leaving notes for them, watch for any unusual happening. This may indicate their intense displeasure which requires concrete remedial action. After all, we’re all sharing the world with other beings which may have been residing at your place than longer your family has. As such, they may be quite attached to their dwelling and therefore very reluctant to move.You could also offer some incense to the tree spirits to soften the blow. Get some nice chandana incense from our temple to show more sincerity.On the other hand, when their blessings run out, they have no choice but move (and therefore cannot impose their displeasure on you). Your kind consideration does make it less painful, but you’re the homeowner who must take your family’s needs into consideration.Be considerate but there is no need to be fearful: in the hierarchy of things (gongfu-wise), you’re no small potatoes yourself."},{"title":"Becoming Vegetarian","content":"Question:Master,I am following your suggestion to become a vegetarian. I try make sure to eat no any egg products or anything from the onion and garlic family. I try to do this when eating with others but as you have noted, there are times when I feel obligated blend in, so as to make them more comfortable and show my appreciation for the meal. There also are times when I may unknowingly eat something that contains items that you suggested we not eat.Is there something I should do, some dharma, when this happens?​BB, Manhattan Beach, California       ​Answer:It’s excellent to become vegetarian!Since I know that you’re in good health, this change indicates growth of your compassionate heart, rather than motivation by health concerns.As you ease gradually into complete vegetarianism, you feel obligated to explain to your close friends and family, who tend to have very strong, albeit unspoken, objections. That’s why it’s important not make a big deal of it. You can show appreciation for the food offered by eating food that is appropriate. For example, the Sixth Patriarch used to eat only veggies cooked next to the meat.Eventually, the people who really care will understand and learn to accept your diet preferences. It does make them feel better when they take special consideration for your diet when you’re a guest.​At times, you can’t eat vegetarian stuff that you like. That’s part of your retribution for obstructing others’ cultivation in the past. For example, as a result of eating onion and garlic, your mantra practice will be less effective for a few days until your body is rid of that odor. When that happens, do not get afflicted, and the next time you’re at the temple, bow (three times or more) to the Buddhas in repentance for such past karmas. You’ll be surprised at how your repentance will quickly make these eating mishaps less frequent."},{"title":"Arrogance","content":"Question:I’m constantly suffering from my arrogance. How can I stop being arrogant? Where can I start?AT, Cerritos, California       Answer:Your awareness of it is a very good start. Arrogance is simply stupidity. For most us, it’s a real turn-off. The Vietnamese have a saying: “your comportment can destroy your looks, cái nết đánh chết cái đẹp.”The more you progress, the less arrogant you will be and you will also be more likeable.​Be vigilant of thoughts of arrogance. Bring forth the mind of shame of such pettiness. You will eventually outgrow it."},{"title":"Repentance for Arrogance","content":"Question: Master,​I sincerely apologize for my arrogance on Saturday [‘s Dharma Talk]. I was more concerned about getting an answer to my question than understanding what you were explaining when you were discussing fighting for promotions and I wanted to know about fighting for a job. I am sorry for my thoughts and actions.      What should I do in these types of situations? Is there a repentance dharma? I know that Long Beach [temple] has a repentance ceremony. Is there a possibility of us having a repentance ceremony in Rosemead [our temple]?​BB, Manhattan Beach, California   Answer:We touched some frayed nerves. Your reaction is just normal.I’m still hoping that you’ll wake up and learn to let go. We can only give with what we have. There is no point in insisting on doing things that we can’t. For example, as you get older and your strength decreases and you can’t be expected to handle the same load that you could when you were younger!For the past few years, I made you sit through your leg pains until they went away by themselves. Can’t you see the parallel? Your job situation is just like the leg pain. Wise people make do and learn to weather the storm. This is what is meant by: “according with conditions.”Your personal growth will also benefit those who depend on you as well. Isn’t your cultural heritage more about sharing what you have rather than expecting an artificial level for standard of living? Meditate on this.Yes, we will have repentance Dharma ceremonies at the temple – eventually. Repentance Dharmas are very important.​For now, I accept your repentance and absolve you of the consequences."},{"title":"Fur Farming","content":"Question:A friend emailed me this article exposing the fur farming industry. Although I would never buy fur, reading this just makes me wonder how the Karmic debts would work out in this case. Will the spirits of the killed animals become hungry ghosts who attack the immediate killer of them or the factory owners or the buyer of the fur coat or all the above in certain amounts. Also is there anything that we can do on our end to lessen the suffering of those unappeased spirits (chanting and dedicating the blessings to them). Thanks for any input.Article: Chinese Fur Farms​JC, San Mateo, California       Answer:Kill and you’ll be killed.Take life and you owe a debt of blood. The victim will not be satisfied until you pay for their sufferings.This karmic debt is stored in our 8th consciousness until it is resolved.​This is why there are mortal enemies, e.g. in the human realm such as suicide bombers. On the surface, these people may seem to be motivated by some so-called heavenly rewards (such as heavenly maidens), but at a deeper level, there is a blood debt settlement between these groups of people."},{"title":"WBPL Vision","content":"Question:Master:​Had an interesting happening Monday (9/07/09) that brings up a question.​Last Monday while working in my parkway, (I overheard your performing a ceremony at your place) your wood fish did a short Emituofo beat and an ending beat. Shortly after, you appeared to be working on your wall flower and plant garden. This caused me arrogantly and egotistically to wonder if the (wood) fish were directed to me to come see you. Started to do that and thought of the arrogance and didn’t.      I decided to meditate on it to find an answer. About 30 minutes into the, closed eye, meditation [sit] a form began to appear. It was a small Buddha in a purple robe seated on a purple lotus in the center of a shining lighted cross-like, plus sign, of light rays bright white in the middle, cerulean, and light blue on the edges. Thought this form was a positive answer to my question. Went to Viet’s house (where you were), but it was all locked up. Thought you might be in meditation so I left. Went home and decided to e-mail you today (Wednesday 9/09/09). I wouldn’t bother you except for the meditation appearance.​MW, Long Beach, California   Answer:It’s remarkable that your skills are improving.What you had was no hallucination (as you well know by now). It was a blurry glimpse from the Western Bliss Pure Land. That’s why we’ve decided to include this in our Q&A section of our web site so that other people can share in your experience. By the way, other people in our Assembly already have similar such vision.Keep in mind that even at your current spiritual attainment; your spiritual skills are insufficient to be able to see the Western Bliss Pure Land because it is quite far away (10 billion Buddhalands away). You received some assistance.I might even venture to suggest that it is a reminder that at this advanced stage of your life and health conditions, you and your wife should take rebirth into the Western Bliss Pure Land more seriously. Plant the seeds for rebirth and the kindness extended to you and your family will not have been in vain.​If you listen to the MP3 recordings of this year’s lectures and Dharma talks that are posted on our web site, you will learn more about the Pure Land Dharma and the many wonderful responses that our Assembly members have obtained."},{"title":"Thyroid Help","content":"Question:Interesting!!!Remember the [30ish] girl I mentioned about at work?

I just spoke with her today and she said her mom went back to Taiwan in July and the doctor said the thyroid problem is gone. I asked what has changed and she didn’t know the answer. When I asked the question I wasn’t thinking about anything.      Then I suddenly remembered that I got her a MMB [Medicine Master Buddha] plaque during the June 13th [2009 Pure Land Dharma] assembly. I wouldn’t have thought much about that either, until Master mentioned about Jenny and her new job. When I got her the plaque I was concerned about her eyes.I went back to check the day I purchased the plaque and the time of her trip and it seems right. The assembly was before she went on her trip. I can’t confirm it, but I’m so happy. It made my day.Thank You!!!​JT, Lake Elsinore, California   Answer: I really appreciate your feedback.It seems that our cultivation is of some benefit to others.You do know how to use plaques to help those who can’t cultivate: at least this kind of Mahayana empowerment Dharma can offer some hope to people.

For example, I don’t know whether to get one super-good item(washcloth, toothbrush, etc.) or ten decent items.​Regarding food, I expect that many people will offer food and there will be excess of perishable and duplicate food items left at the temple. Is it appropriate to offer a grocery store gift card? Or, should I just not worry about excessive perishable and redundant food offerings.      There are many good material things that I could offer, but perhaps temple already has most of these things. It’s just like they will use the space to store excessive material things if not used.​Also, since Master Xuan Hua was very frugal, is it good to offer fancy or extravagant material things to the temple.DT, Cerritos, California   Answer:Every year, the temple gets lots of toothpaste, toothbrushes etc. They tend to pile up. I even remember the head monk of the temple, where I practiced as a novice, getting afflicted and publicly announcing that we no longer needed dental supplies!Similarly, we also get a lot of perishable food that we can’t consume before it spoils.It should not stop the donors because we can always share them with the food pantries. After all, we are to be the happy field of blessings, aren’t we?If you’re aren’t sure, you can ask the temple abbot or give money.Please keep in mind that you should make the offerings with the mindset of deep respect and desire to provide necessities for the sanghans. For example, if you have the opportunity to cook something with your own hands and time, it would represent “100 flavors” food: it does not mean that you have to be extravagant. Nor does it mean that the sanghans have to like it.Best quality means not stingy – it does not imply extravagance. The flip side is to check whether or not you fear spending money or have post giving dissonance (regret having giving that much!).I actually sat through feasts during this time of the year when I was in Taiwan. Taiwanese donors often offered feasts on numerous occasions during the summer retreat. Personally, I was embarrassed to have to sit through these times, partly because I felt ashamed of my lack of merit & virtues; I certainly do not feel that feasting is appropriate, especially during hard economic times, when lots of people do not have enough food to nourish their families. On the other hand, I felt compelled to enjoy the food offerings with my colleagues; I did not want to appear unappreciative nor spoil their pleasure.Some would offer a new set of robes, sashes and (sangha) sandals to the sanghans of the temple. This tradition dates back to times when sanghans did not have enough appropriate clothing – the gift of a robe would make their day.If you expend time and effort to provide for the necessities of temple, that will suffice. With this intention, your ancestors will thus be provided for. That’s what Ullambana means to me personally; the opportunity to get things that we need for our practice also results in ample luxuries to your ancestors and living parents. Why luxuries to your elders? It’s because necessities to us are the equivalent of luxuries to lay people – It’s the greatest luxury to be able to continue to cultivate!A final word of caution: if you’re getting afflicted by going through this exercise, you’re on the wrong track. It’s about devoting the time to give it your best shot. It’s just like looking for a gift for your mother on her birthday. Most mothers appreciate the thought and efforts behind the gift more than the gift itself. Similarly, your ancestors will obtain the corresponding blessings from your goodwill.​Stop obsessing on succeeding in your endeavors. Try your best and learn to be happy with that. It’s the intention of your kindness and filiality that moves heaven and earth, not the pleasure (or afflictions) of the sanghans!"},{"title":"Ullambana Offering: Medicine Master Plaque","content":"Question:How about Medicine Master Plaque for the Sanghan of the Ten Directions?

Do we buy all those items and make the offering? Or if there are more friendly ways to make the Ullambana offering?September 3 is the real day for Ullambana. Do we make the offering on that day? Or is it the same that we do it on Sunday?DT, Cerritos, California   Answer: For the Ullambana Festival, the lay people should make offerings as follows:1. Hand carry the “basins” (water vessels) containing “food of the 100 flavors; the five kinds of fruits/ grains; incense, candles (lights), banners (adornments); beds, beddings, (alms) bowls, clothing, basins”2. Of the highest quality3. (Make the offering) with utmost sincerity4. To the Sangha of the 10 DirectionsLet me provide some clarifications:1. Personally carry your offerings to the temple.* One can personally cook the food/fruit or purchase it: of these, rice is the most important item and the rest represent the daily food necessities of the Sangha. This may also include medicine.* Incense, candles (lights), banners (adornments): other daily necessities for religious (ceremonious) work.* Beds, beddings, (alms) bowls, clothing, basins: The 3rd kind of utensils: clothes to shelter against the wind and cold, bed to shelter against the weather, etc.2. Of the highest quality: that one can afford. It should not be the case that you hold back on the expenses so that you have more for yourself.3. With the utmost sincerity: is the key here. Make the offerings of the things that you feel that the sangha needs. It’s for the sake of providing blessings to your ancestors so that they have ample necessities (without lacking anything).4. To the Sangha of the 10 Directions: because the left home people at the local temple are only representatives who will accept the offerings to the Sangha of the 10 Directions. Making the offerings with such a mindset enables you to obtain blessings for making offerings to all the virtuous Sangha of the Dharma Realm (versus currying favors of the local Sangha only)."},{"title":"Quelling Natural Disasters","content":"Question: Is there any appropriate plaque or ceremony we can do for Taiwan?​AT, Cerritos, California       Answer: Good indeed! Good indeed! Your compassionate mind is manifesting itself.From a causal perspective, we cultivators are to blame for these natural disasters because of our lack of virtues. It is said that true cultivators can create a perimeter of security around the area where they cultivate. For example, when Great Master Xuan Hua (of the CTTB) was in San Francisco, there was no earthquake or natural disaster.Traditionally, in order to appease the gods, spirits and ghosts who are bent on destruction and inflicting pain and sufferings, people would set up an altar in the afflicted area and then ask virtuous sanghans to conduct quelling disasters ceremonies. Making such offerings to the Triple Jewel seemed to soothe their anger and provided much needed relief. Historically speaking, this kind of intervention has ended natural disasters such as severe drought, epidemics, flooding, etc.​At a smaller scale, locally, we could try doing up to three intervention (special) ceremonies, say in three consecutive weeks."},{"title":"Listening to Sutra Lecture Recording","content":"Question: Is it proper to listen to Sutra lecture recordings while driving, working, or walking?​DT, Cerritos, California       Answer: Sutra lectures are very formal events. Before each lecture, we’d perform a Dharma request procedure in order to:Benefit all living beings by requesting the Dharma transmission. After all, the Mahayana spirit in cultivation is to ultimately help others.Remind ourselves that we need to pay attention to show our respect and gratitude. Our ability to absorb the teachings correlates directly to our level of concentration. We’ve noticed that quite a few of our participants entered samadhi during the Sutra lectures.That’s why a purist would frown at listening to Sutra lecture recordings while engaging in other activities.We feel that one should be more flexible and accord with the conditions (environment). Therefore, it’s better to listen to those recordings while driving, working, or walking, etc., if it replaces other not useful activities such as daydreaming.However, please make sure to pay attention to the task at hand. For example, if you enter samadhi while driving and listening to the recordings, it may cause more harm than good.Furthermore, we assume that when you mentioned “while working”, you meant while at work. For example, a night watchman at work, a computer operator at her console, etc., all these instances require minimal mental processing and thus the mind can register the lecture materials. Even so, keep in mind that the materials can only be efficiently registered in proportion to the concentration level."},{"title":"Tailgate Karma","content":"Question:​I have a friend who I have warned not to tailgate for quite some time. I advised him that by doing so karma will come back. Last Friday it seems that it did. Since he usually tailgates people even on the highway to the point that he is less than 1 car length away from the car in front of him. I warned him that he will make the person in front nervous and feel agitated. Anyway last Friday karma seems to have taught him a lesson.      He was approaching an intersection and the cars in front of him were slow and guess what happened from behind, somebody who was tailgating him hit him. He got whiplash from the incident. I had to take him to the hospital. It took more than 3 hrs to examine him since they put him in a room and forgot about him. He also went to work that Sat against the Doctors advise and made his whiplash worse. But now it is getting better after I told him to slow it down and not tailgate so much. Very interesting case. Since karmic retribution is very accurate. I was shocked that it can be this accurate.​JC, San Mateo, California   Answer:​Thank you for sharing the story.We hope that your friend gets it: one gets what one sows. You are quite right: the law of cause & effect is never off even by a hair.​In the long run, he needs to pay attention to his tendency for aggression. It makes him a rather unpleasant fellow to have around."},{"title":"Cooking Meat for Others","content":"Question: I have a question that arose while visiting my cousin this weekend. When visiting I try and be helpful in appreciation for his hospitality. Sometimes he will ask me to help cook food on the grill. While I don’t eat any of the meat that is cooked I wonder if cooking it for others is something I should try to avoid. You have taught me to blend so I have applied that in the cooking of meat for others. Am I following your direction correctly?​BB, Manhattan Beach, California       Answer:You did the right thing to “blend in”.It’s not only to show your appreciation, but it’s also to show your kindness:To your host and guests: in helping them at the grill, you’re helping to nourish their body.While you do not eat meat, it’s OK to cook meat for them if they ask for your help.There is a small little thing that you should learn to take care of: We don’t eat meat to avoid engaging in a killing cycle: we kill animals to eat their flesh; they then in turn will kill us and eat ours to return the favor. This is inevitable because of the law of cause and effect.Even though you did not directly engage on the meat purchase for consumption (and thus perpetuating the cycle), you however did directly get yourself involved in meat consumption by grilling the meat.In this case, you could have recited the Amitabha Buddha’s name while you were at the grill and dedicated the recitation to those animals. Or purchase a little rebirth plaque on their behalf next time you are at a Pure Land Assembly.​This is called turning hatred into gratitude through kindness, turning potential adversaries into future friends."},{"title":"Fear of Flying","content":"Question:​My friend tells me not to fly because of his dream. He indicates things happen in his dream and they are not exactly good. He not only tells me but warns me of flying. He tells me his dreams come true and they often do. One time he told another friend he saw in his dream this friend and his girlfriend went on bike trip and they would have a baby soon after. Low and behold, a year or two later, this couple went on a bike trip and now the girlfriend is 4 months pregnant. So if his dreams hold, then I want to know if there’s other ways other than avoiding flying entirely. I love to travel at the same time I want to enjoy and not worry about flying. Your help is greatly appreciated.​PW, New York       Answer:​That is called premonition-dreams. Your friend has potential.Since you already have the Medicine Master Buddha plaque, it also does provide for accrual for protection against accidental deaths such as automobile crash, air plane accident etc… This will be explained later in our current Medicine Master Sutra lectures.To slice it in a different fashion: the premonition-dreams may reveal existing threats or mal-intentioned forces but they do not necessarily reflect the countervailing protective forces.​You therefore should not fear flying. When you do need to fly, please remember to recite Medicine Master Buddha’s name, i.e. mentally maintain: 藥師如來 (Yao Shi Ru Lai; Dược Sư Như Lai) repeatedly. It’ll calm your mind down while providing for additional protection."},{"title":"Drawing Images","content":"Question:​I have questions regarding drawing imaging of Earth Store Bodhisattva.Quote from chapter 6, page 37 of the sutra“Universally Expansive, if good men or good women gaze upon and bow but once to painted or drawn images of the Bodhisattva or ones made of clay, or stone, or lacquer, or gold, or silver, or bronze, they will be reborn one hundred times in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and will eternally avoid falling into the evil paths.”1. If we draw it with computer programs does that count?​2. What if we delete the files after we drew the picture? Does that count? Is that consider making offense?       Answer:​1. Yes it does.​2. While designing the image, those files do not count. However, upon completion of your design work, those files are “images” of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. They should be treated as such. Why would you want to delete them? In fact, you could “move” them to our web site so that they can be shared."},{"title":"Creating Boundaries and Purifying Meditation Space","content":"Question: ​​Would it help us to cultivate 定力 (samadhi power) if we clear our boundaries before we sit? Will it help the false thinking to go away?​Article: 橫相惱亂你有這種心裡煩亂的情形，這是魔王來破壞你，你應該誦〈大悲咒〉，你一念〈大悲咒〉，這些鬼神、魔王，就都給抓起來，用繩索綁上。      Answer: Yes it does help to create boundaries for an area where you meditate. That, for example, is why people go to a Chan hall, because boundaries are already established.I won’t go into the process of creating the boundaries and purifying a meditation space (anticipating your next follow up question) because it’s too involved. If you have Buddha or Bodhisattva images at home, sitting next to them will suffice.The Chinese article is inaccurate. If you are afflicted with false thinking (your monkey mind can’t seem to stop), reciting the Great Compassion mantra does not always help. I know because I have tried it more than once.Your false or scattered thinking results from your conscious mind grasping at internal things or external things. For example, if external sounds (like your neighbor’s television or stereo) annoy you, reciting the Da Bei Zhou (Great Compassion Mantra) is not going to help. In particular, if you are harassed by external ghosts or demons (like those the Chinese article refers to), reciting mantras may provide no relief at all.You must understand, however, that it’s not because the mantra does not work; it’s because your recitation power is not adequate. For example, a baseball can certainly break window glass, but only when it’s thrown with sufficient force!In general, when you sit and try to practice Chan, but your mind is spinning:Try to stop indulging in false thinking – at least know that it’s the wrong time for it.As soon as you are aware that your mind is drifting, stop and concentrate on your Chan technique.Do not get discouraged. It’s an uphill battle – keep trying!The savvy Chan practitioner has various remedies and techniques. Your Chan Master can teach you these over time.Regardless of whether or not you have various remedies (step 4), if you sit long enough, false thinking will diminish and disappear.Unfortunately, most people quit because they get afflicted and discouraged. If this happens consistently, seek a good knowing advisor. You need a teacher’s help."},{"title":"Sitting in Meditation vs Tasking","content":"Question: ​What is the difference between sitting with your legs crossed while doing a task versus sitting in meditation with your legs crossed?​I came across this site and found the articles to be quite interesting      Answer:​It’s too much beating around the bush!When you cross your legs, it will lessen your mental outflows. As a result, your head is clearer. It thus enables you to be more productive.For example, when sitting in front of your computer, on your sofa in front of the television, at your drafting table, etc., crossing your legs will help make you more productive mentally as well as increase your stamina.Therefore, sitting in full lotus can sharpen your focus and speed up the mental processing of your conscious mind.​On the other hand, when we sit in full lotus to do Chan meditation, our objective is to become single-minded. As we become more skilled, we can still our conscious mind."}]
